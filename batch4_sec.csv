62,"1. Who knows 2. Who knows.

I'm looking at .0065 ETH for potential double bottom, if that fails, .006 should see enough support for at least a semi-decent swing trade but I wouldn't count on it not going lower after a bounce. 3k sats is around the same price and has previously served as resistance so there's a reason to believe it holds. In case we smash through these levels, there could be another dump before we finally see the bottom. 

My two cents.

And as for buy orders, I'd go 50% now and 50% after a clear breakout in either direction, not going to predict the levels though as this is already some tea leaf stuff. ",0.3142,daily_general_discussion_december_27_2017,0.044,0.893,0.063

146,"Most people (including myself) can't really ignore the shilling, the small people who can are the ones who can make a shit ton of money by trading.

The advice I use for myself is that you should always keep in the back of your mind that you're a human and therefore extremely susceptible to confirmation bias, especially when you're young (<25 years old) and money is involved. That also means that everyone else is too, so a post with a ton of upvotes about how ""this project is amazing and this coin extremely undervalued"" doesn't necessarily mean it's actually true or a good quality post, and the same goes for negative posts with a ton of downvotes. People tend to agree/upvote posts and opinions that agree with their own which in turn causes their opinion/view to become stronger (whether it's positive or negative), the /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc subreddits are prime examples of this.

Always get your information from multiple sources and try to give every positive and negative thing you read a ""value"" of the quality of it, e.g. when you read posts on subreddits about a specific coin about how ""the price will surely go up"" with a large number of upvotes but without any argument as to why you should probably just ignore it, even though you'll feel that you want to agree with it if it's a coin that you have personally invested in since it confirms what you're already thinking and hoping. And like I said before, the same goes for negative posts that you'll tend to want to ignore since they are controversial to your own opinion.",0.961,daily_general_discussion_december_27_2017,0.053,0.807,0.14

As a result you are benchmarking your portfolio against a hypothetical portfolio in which you just invested in BTC. As a result you should be tracking the satoshi value of your portfolio as that is how you can tell if you are doing better or worse than a pure BTC investment. If your satoshi value is going down then you are underperforming BTC, but if it goes up then you are outperforming BTC.

So if you have those two I'd just bite the bullet and transfer some to binance, those fees are minimal in the grand scheme of things. 

If you have bitcoin on the other hand... I can't speak to that as much since I never bought into it. But from what I've heard its fees are much higher, around $25 or more potentially, so if you're dealing one the order of hundreds it's best to just HODL or sell and buy-in with ETH or LTC.

729,"Ok honestly I disagree pretty heavily with the hodling comments. You're succumbing to sunken cost fallacy. Although you may have initially invested 340, that is not what you possess at this point. You are now in possession of 240, plain and simple. It sucks that you are down but you just have to accept it. Now you need to be rational, and make smart choices. What in your opinion do you think would be the most effective way to turn that 240 back into the 340 you invested? Do you believe that by putting it into XRB you will get back to 340, or do you believe that LTC is going to do that instead.

If you want my personal opinion here, then I would say it's safer to hodl but you have more to gain by putting into XRB. No one knows how big XRB is going to blow up but considering it still hasn't gotten into any major exchanges yet it seems like there's huge potential for growth. Possibly going to see it at 4x its current value by the end of January. Do you think that LTC will grow that much? Idk I can't say I know enough to say.

All I'm saying is don't think you can't spend your LTC bc it's lower than the value you bought it at, that's not smart because you will screw yourself out of many opportunities. Instead just pretend you invested 240 and you'd like to turn that 240 into 340 ASAP. What's the best way to get there, you decide.",0.9938,daily_general_discussion_december_27_2017,0.046,0.759,0.195

927,"Staking, sometimes referred to as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), is an alternative way of securing the blockchain & mining. Usually you lock funds up for some period of time and then help the network by verifying transactions. PoS is interesting because you can get a return on your currency similar to dividends, and it could work as an alternative to PoW mining, but there are some technical issues.

There are lots of different PoS coins and they can work different ways. Some require huge amounts to form a master node to participate. Others allow anyone to stake. For example with Decred, you lock up funds in a ticket for a random period of time, and then get paid part of the block reward from when your ticket is drawn and helps validate that block.

For some perspective, check the [list of accidents involving commercial aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft#2017) and look at the last few years. The aeron website says there are 100,000 flights per day. Notice how few accidents there are compared to that. Then take out any accidents caused by terrorism, weather, and mechanical issues as this coin doesn't solve those. Finally, notice which countries these accidents occur most in (Turkey and Taiwan for example) and ask yourself how likely those countries are to adopt blockchain technology any time soon.

1470,"Personally, I think it has the potential to be pretty important in the crypto world. People will try to compare it to other privacy coins like monero , but that is not the point of ENG. From what I understand, it is attempting to set up a protocol to make data on blockchains using smart contracts private. One of the main problems with blockchain tech is that even though it is anonymous, the data is public.  For example, this is a problem for companies trying to transfer proprietary info or hospitals transferring health care documents, ENG is trying to solve that.",0.7351,daily_general_discussion_december_26_2017,0.064,0.797,0.139
1471,"Enigma (ENG) is a protocol/platform that is being built to be able to link into existing platforms, such as Ethereum for now, but will eventually be linked into all major blockchains, to allow smart contacts to be executed with their contents kept secret/private.  The main issue with current platforms are  that they are transparent. All information is visible. There are, in fact, situations where you don't want your information to be publicly visible, but you still want to efficiencies of blockchain technology. Your medical records is a good example. So the way to address this is to execute a smart contact with the contents of it encrypted to keep it private. Existing platforms can't facilitate this, so ENIGMA is a platform that will allow dapps to be built on top of it with an emphasis on secrecy.  The dapp will execute the smart contract on enigma, thus enigma will encrypt it, then enigma will interface with the ethereum (eth) platform,  eth will process the transaction on the eth blockchain, however the contents will be secret, as opposed to the rest of the info on the eth blockchain.  Enigma is partnering to build bridges/interfaces with many existing platforms. Therefore ENIGMA compliments existing platforms (platforms are like ETH, NEO, etc), it isn't trying to replace them. Think of Enigma as a layer on top of existing platforms providing a secret service when desired in certain situations. There is nothing else like this in crypto.  Don't compare this to a coin like monero, because enigma is not a coin, it's a platform on which specialised secrecy dapps will be built.

Private smart contracts and anonymous dapps allow companies to use Blockchain tech without worrying about giving away company data. 

It wouldn't be surprising to me to see Enigma become the go to platform for large companies. 

Edit: If anyone's interested in Enigma I highly suggest you read [this blog post](https://blog.enigma.co/why-enigmas-privacy-protocol-will-power-our-decentralized-future-aedb8c9ee2f6) by the developers. It highlights real world use cases for the product. Also not to mention they've already created one dapp and are working on others.

They range from 5,000% to 10,000% increases. Thats 50 to 100 times. If you're investing 50$ or so at a time thats the kind of returns you're looking for. These coins started at pennies, gained popularity and are now worth hundreds/thousands. Can bitcoin increase 50 to 100x from 15k? As someone completely uninformed im thinking its more likely for a coin worth cents to do that than bitcoin. If you go on binance.com you can look at the 24hr volume and see which are the most popular at the moment.   
  
What I've been doing is buying BTC/ETH/LTC or whatever on coinbase as a jumping off point. You send that to binance and from there exchange for whatever altcoin you want to put money into. They have almost everything on binance if you have BTC. If I had that I'd buy the full 100$ into one coin, probably BTC. It takes a week or so to clear. In the meantime do some research, pick 4-5 coins, watch them closely on binance. When the money comes into coinbase transfer it and its pretty easy to exchange for the altcoin youve decided on. If youre at 100$ id stick to one coin. The transfer fees will hit more and transfer minimums alone on some sites are very close to 100$ BTC. I think the BTC transfer minimum on gatehub is .005 which is about 100$, might be the same for binance.

I, personally, only invest in tokens that have a use in the product being created so that was problem number one for me. Problem two is that, like I said, its the same as buying a stock in a company. Unlike stocks, however, you have zero legal protection. They could straight up decide not to pay people dividends and keep the profit for themselves, and you'd have no legal recourse. 

edit: I should clarify that I haven't seen any reason that they wouldn't end up paying the dividends. They seem like a good team of people, not to mention it'd do huge damage to their brand if they fucked everyone over. Also they're extremely close to releasing their product and have several partnerships. They'll be one of the first actual blockchain products being used in the real world by end of Q1 2018 which will be huge. If you can get over the lack of legal protection, I'd say its a good buy.

My main recommmendation is to do your own research, there are going to be weeks where you wish you invested in certain projects because they're getting pumped hard, and there are going to be weeks where you wish you sold because they're getting dumped hard. Ignore the shillers, and do your own research. It's not just the money (though it's great), it's the tech too. What do you believe in? If you're into complete privacy ENG, and XMR are in that realm. If you like the idea of ad less websites (and instead lend the company your GPU for mining WITH consent) look at prl. If you're into the IOT space (and you should be), IOTA and I believe XRB.

2814,"60% in the big established coins split however you wish. I'd only put 3, maybe 4 in this category. BTC, ETH, LTC, XMR. Boom, easiest part of your portfolio, only way this loses is if the entire market crashes. Don't fuck with these, just hodl.

Another 25% in coins that are newer but with solid tech. There's a lot of options here, look into them and pick just a few that you believe in, maybe 3 or 4 here as well. Examples: IOTA, ARK, NEO, XLM, OMG, XRB, REQ, VET, WTC. There's a lot.

Final 15% in slightly riskier newer low market cap coins that have a chance to do some big growth. You need to do a lot of research on these and even then we're talking a slight leap of faith. I'm talking coins not even on the top 100 of CMC, but that you think could get there. There's a lot of these, and finding one that's trustworthy can be a real bitch. This section is the closest to a gamble, but any one of these taking off could easily end up matching your ""safer"" investments in value. Examples include PRL, HST, ENG, XBY, COSS, there's a bunch, and seems like a new one every day. I'd pick just a couple of these. Too hard to watch all of the news and monitor if it's time to bounce or not, like juggling.

If you're feeling more like risk, and willing to monitor news for every investment every day, then tweak ratios, for example 40/30/30. If you're feeling more like hodl, do something like 75/20/5. ",0.9864,daily_general_discussion_december_25_2017,0.056,0.766,0.178

3084,"I’m not smart enough to be able to look at the technical aspects of IOTA, or really any project, and be able to see if the math works etc. There are people who say that the IOTA project can never work, and those that say of course it can. The problem is you need a PHD in mathematics/computer science to be able to form your own opinion. 99.9% of the people who say it is the future, or a scam, on reddit really have no clue.

With that said, it’s the majority of my portfolio. Why? 
1.	The IOTA foundation is a non-profit aimed at growing/developing the IOTA network and has hundreds of millions in financing (Billions?). 
2.	One of the main developers (Come-From-Beyond) invented PoS and has earned a little credit in the crypto realm. He thinks it will put blockchain out of business. 
3.	The huge, multinational conglomerate Bosch just bought a ‘sizable amount’ of IOTA to hold for future use. They definitely have the resources and technical ability to look at and evaluate the nitty gritty of a project to determine if it is feasible.
4.	They don’t have any true competitors in their target market right now. Fast, fee-less transactions geared toward the machine economy. (People bring up Raiblocks, but Raiblock’s creator has stated they have no plans to implement data transfer across the Rai network, so they can’t compete with IOTA in the M2M realm).
5.	While IOTA has no current competition, if IOTA works as promised, it can compete in almost any realm. 
6.	It’s already quantum resistant, which very few coins are.

You can read why people are concerned about IOTA all over the sub. I’ll leave that to others. I think the biggest complaints are the network currently being slow, the current wallet not being user friendly, and the Devs speaking like real people in their 20’s/30’s instead of corporate talking heads.

3154,"The easy high level answer to that, is all the coins are valued off the current value of BTC this is why you see most exchanges in terms of satoshis. That being said (anyone correct me if Im wrong), a logical trader would hold onto what he values (what will be hard to replace given market fluctuations). IF BTC jumps from 13k -17k on the regular but I feel its going to be leveling back out closer to 17k Im not going to spend it. XRP on the other hand probably isnt going to make any significant moves quickly so Id rather spend that as it will be easier to replace if need be. 

All that being said.... There are only a few main Alts you can trade for one another (not having to first convert to Bitcoin). For instance, you could not do a direct trade of XRP for XMR, you would first need to convert the XRP to something widely used like BTC or ETH and then purchase your XMR .

Tron.  Trx has 100 billion coins and a market cap of 2.4 billion at a coin price of 3 cents.

Compare that to:
Genesis vision.  GVT has around 4 million coins and a market cap of around 33 million at a price of 6.50. 

Both are projects that look to enter/disrupt trillion dollar industries ~ but one of them have the potential to 100x while the other is currently topped out.

-	DeepOnion: Daily trade volume of $186865

-	Oyster Pearl: Daily trade volume of $1600914
-	Dragonchain: Daily trade volume of $1257528

3543,"My two cents:

1. It is wise to invest only what you can afford to lose, or rather, what you are willing to lose. Personally, I'm aiming to get better returns than simply storing my money in the bank/stocks and bonds.
2. I'd say -- don't get too greedy. Your gains on Blockfolio/Delta are only realised after you've cashed it out. How you determine what is 'too greedy' or 'not too greedy' is entirely up to you.
3. I wouldn't diversify too much personally -- i think that if you've done your due diligence ie. read the white paper, checked out the team, checked their progress through their road map, CHECKED IF THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A FUNCTIONING PRODUCT etc, you shouldn't fear putting more money into these baskets. 
4. Most on Reddit recommend only spending what you can afford to lose to avoid complications like the issue on taxes -- eg. if the coins i bought rose by 2x - 5x or even more and i find that such prices are artificially inflated (hint: BCC), i definitely wouldn't mind paying taxes on them to cash it out. Likewise, if you believe in the long term potential of your coins, hodling shouldn't be an issue. ",0.9369,daily_general_discussion_december_24_2017,0.047,0.827,0.126

You can still make your own token on top of erc20 though.  

It also has smart contracts which are a way to specify a contract, like say you want to buy something but you don't want to send the money until the other person has proven they've put your item into the hands of the third party ready to ship. When you send the money, the third party ships the item.  

XMR is the privacy coin. If you send someone money, no one can tell that you sent money, how much you sent, who you sent it to, or even when you sent it.

It will not die off entirely, but I think eventually it will only have a small sentimental value to most people and it will go down in the history books. Bitcoin has failed itself as a currency due to its inherent scalability limitations, and it is not doing a great job at being a ""store of value"" either thanks to the volatility. Because of this, I feel that bitcoins value is far inferior to a coin like ether, where its value is derived from its success as a platform. Ethereum has a roadmap towards scalability, and with the Casper release I believe ethereum will be the number one crypto by market cap. There are so many indicators now that all are pointing to this so I suggest you best prepare yourself for this shift.

Let's use Ethereum as an example. If you were to go back 30 days and buy Ethereum, you would have got it around $400-$450 USD each. During the drop we've just had, Ethereums lowest point was around $600-$650 USD. Still substantially higher than it was 30 days ago.

Here's some ""major"" coins for example - 
Bitcoin: 30 days ago - $8k-$8.5k and after the dip - $12kish.
Neo: 30 days ago - $35-$38 and after the dip - $45ish

I'm sure there are some exceptions, but for the most part you'd be better of having purchased 30 days ago and just holding on to the coins than you would have been buying during the recent dip.

3949,"Cryptocurrencies are only part of the picture. Let's refer to all of the coins on the market as cryptoassets. There are 3 distinct types of cryptoassets; cryptocurrencies, cryptocommodities and cryptotokens. Cryptocurrencies are intended to be used as a medium of transfer and store of value (as a currency). Some examples of cryptocurrencies are: Litecoin, Bitcoin, Monero... Cryptocommodities are akin to resources such as oil and gas. They can be utilized on the blockchain, for example, Ether is a cryptocommodity that can be used on the Ethereum blockchain to perform computations. Finally, cryptotokens are tokens issued on existing blockchains as part of a final product or service. For example, OmiseGo is cryptotoken issued on the Ethereum blockchain that can be used to secure the OmiseGo network through staking. 

So no, the goal isn't to have one type of cryptoasset as there are many different types of cryptoassets that serve different purposes. ",0.3197,daily_general_discussion_december_24_2017,0.017,0.951,0.032
3950,"I'd make a distinction between currency-like coins and blockchain technologies in general . The purpose of some coins is to act like a currency, while for others its more of a fee for using its blockchain. For example Bitcoin is a currency whereas ether is the fee for using the Ethereum blockchain to do distributed computations of smart contracts. 

All of them use the basic underlying mathematics of cryptography so that users can feel secure in their interactions with the blockchain. After that, each coin is designed for a different purpose.

In the future, some like Ethereum or IOTA or ARK may not even be used directly by people but instead will be the underlying method a company or banks will use. 

Maybe you'll get paid in Bitcoin but convert it to somelike like DASH or Litecoin or Raiblocks for everyday use of small amounts. Maybe you'll use Monero when you want to be totally anonymous. Maybe you'll use Ripple or Stellar when you go on holidays and want to transfer into local currency.

4222,"Read those reddit titled like ""your best picks for 2018"" or "" shill me you coin""  or "" what tje next 10x coin"".

Find a coin that is mention several times ~ check its chart.  If has already gone up a lot than move on.  If it hasnt then check its market cap: lower the better but it all depends on coins in circulation so learn to get a feel for a good market cap.

If it looks good head over to the reddit and see what people are saying ~  i look for stuff like:  "" why are not people buying, this coin has a great future????""....  check how many devs and are they active....

Finally:  do not fomo into buying while its rising.  Only buy on dips.  Check the chart (15m) and find the likely support for a dip.  Then buy some and wait till the rest of the community starts hearing about it and let them fomo while you sell.

Another stradegy is if your exchange allows you  to have foat sitting on the account and especially if they have coins paired with fiat.  Mine does so what i do is what for the inevitable next bitcoin crash and then i buy all the discounted alts that are 20%+ down.

4270,"My own input: Switching to cryptocurrency would save the average homeowner $500 per year by not using VISA, as stores need to pay a small fee to VISA for their services, so they need to mark their prices up a bit to cover that. As it's an international currency, this would make the transition from banks to credit unions for storage of USD more convenient, as the problem of ""what if I'm away from home and need an ATM?"" is removed from the picture. People's wallets are accessible via QR codes and you give them money by scanning the QR code. IMO crypto won't replace the US dollar completely, but it will work alongside it really well. What it will do is reduce the need for physical cash/coins and VISA cards, thereby reducing the need for banks and saving people money. But maybe I'll be wrong about that, who knows.

Airline tickets will have to be cheaper to cover the fact that people won't use their miles to get free flights. Plus there are already airline services that do things such as monthly subscription fees which are already better than FF miles. They usually don't have bag checks or TSA agents when you go with these, because they do a background check when you sign up.

He focuses only on the impracticality of Bitcoin based on its speed and fees, but he does not mention emerging currencies that use DAGs to optimize the transaction time and cost. IOTA and XRB are two competitive ones in this, you can read about [here](https://hackernoon.com/iota-vs-raiblocks-413679bb4c3e).

He briefly mentions things that are good ideas, like IoT technologies like a washing machine that orders its own detergent. Much like Paul Krugman's stupidity in not being able to predict the impact of the internet on economics, this author is pretending like the IoT won't have a massive impact on the economy, which is just completely stupid. He mentions these technologies and then scoffs at them without giving any clear reason why.

There are a few options out there for offline wallets and I strongly encourage thoroughly researching which one is best for your needs.

Two wallets to start looking at are Ledger Nano S and Trezor. You can find a list of coins supported by each online.

For the actual noobs -  In the UK keep all transactions actions under 9k or it will flag with the banks. Also Selling through coinbase means accepting an offer sell price which may be overlooked when you are staring at the transaction fee. You are accepting sell prices when moving from coin to fiat - and that is why you only ever seem to break even on day trading - these losses are not included in the transaction fee. To park 12k of btc back in the good old days, into fiat cost me E140 in transaction fees and E650 difference between buy and sell price - this was not a fluctuation in the market - but an instant transaction within coinbase! Getting whacked with E800 on 12k is not great to cash out on. Do some research on debit cards - and live on crypto as and when you need to. The banks don't need to know about whats left over in cyberspace. Problem with Coinbase is they are now asking for website  info as to where you are moving your money - if it equates to over £2K.

Bitcoin is unusable in its current state and people like Roger Ver are making sure everyone knows that (I think he's an asshole, but sadly, his points about BTC are completely valid). It's only a matter of time when the recent buyers wake up to the fact that they're holding a slow, expensive token that isn't really even accepted anywhere and experience the buyer's remorse, triggering a chain event. 

The entire growth of Bitcoin right now comes from people buying because they believe that demand will grow and more people will buy, who also think demand will grow et cetera. It's a vicious cycle and extremely similar to a ponzi right now. Think about it; Bitcoin's value comes (or should come) from it being a *decentralized currency*, but what is left once the ""currency"" part is dropped? Decentralized *what*, exactly?

4640,"Well let's do some quick math. 

Their current *total* token supply is 400m.  Their circulating supply is unknown, but let's just say they have 400m tokens out there with with a price of $4 per coin (and understand that this is just a theoretical exercise for perspective). That puts them at a market cap of around 1.6b.  

They have an *extremely* ambitious progress, with a great team and backing behind them. 

They easily have a far more ambitious, useful, and global ambition than a coin like TRX, which has a 3 billion market cap right now. 

So, let's say ICX reaches Ethereum's market cap.  A not-impossible scenario, given a few years. 

That would mean an approx 40x increase in value for them, from 1.5b to 60b. 

The value of a single coin would go from $4 to $160. 

And if they *succeed* in their ambition, I'd say that's a bit of a conservative estimate. 

But you need ot be prepared to hold them for at least two years, maybe as long as five, and to monitor them for red flags that they're not going to succeed in their project. 

But I'd say of all the coins out there, I think this one stands a pretty good chance of substantial long term growth.

Skimming the whitepaper, it sounds like a good concept, sounds a lot like Ardor. It's an ERC20 token that allows the creation of child tokens backed by staking OST. The gas price of transactions is paid in OST. OST aims to have 
 10x the transaction throughput of Ethereum to begin with. The child tokens are redeemable for OST  and other child tokens. The use case example they give is airline miles. Instead of redeeming an arbitrary amount for a plane ticket, the airline child OST token would have value based on the OST value. So you could sell your airline tokens and buy Arby's tokens at a much lower gas price than if the airline and Arby's had completely separate ERC20 tokens.

Or like in manufacturing, switching over automobile lines would take hours/days. Now that can be done way more quickly and the usecases pile up. Viewing streaming data and building triggers on that, or being able to produce many more car variants against lower costs.

Nope. Most crypto news articles & websites are trying to shill you their own bags. Start with reading the Bitcoin whitepaper, and grind it out until you understand more than half of what they are talking about. Browse the details on coinmarket cap. Some fundamentals for evaluating coins:

What was the initial distribution of the coin?

How are new coins created?

Is there a max cap? If so, what % of coins are created already? If not, oh boy... What is the inflation schedule?

What is the market cap?

How centralized/decentralized is the coin? Is it decentralized at all? Could someone turn it ""off"" if they wanted to?

I lost a lot money since yesterday because i was trading shitty coins which made me a lot of money before, truth is this should be a reality check for people so they put their money in real projects that they believe in and don't care if their price fluctuates. I still think the market cap is extremely high at 422B, these companies are not generating half of that money, if its pure accounting this market cap should be less than 100B. Take Cardano for an example (nothing against it, could be the biggest company in the world in the future) reached 14B in MC, that's bigger than the NFL+MLB combined with no actual product yet, do you really think that this is reality? Hell no. Also lets be real here, there is a lot of money being laundered here, take Tron for an example, they are pushing people to trade as much as possible in order to be able to win a Maserati, who the fuck does that? they reached a 4 billion cap space with no actual product, this is complete insanity. As much as i hate to say this, but its going to continue doing this every few months unless we have regulations, i don't want regulations so i expect this happen, its a double edged sword.

5950,"It all comes down to opportunity cost. So it depends on how those alts perform compared to bitcoin. 

If Bitcoin went from 13,000 to 20,000 that would be about a 54% increase. 

Any altcoins you are holding would need to perform *just as good or better* in order to make more profits than if you were just holding bitcoin. 

If you decide to hold alts instead of bitcoin and the altcoins do not perform as well as btc you will incur an opportunity cost equal to the difference between the two performances 

(Ex: buy $100 worth of alt at $0.50/token or buy $100 worth of btc at $13000/coin. At the end of the week bitcoin rises to $26,000 and alt rises to $0.75. Bitcoin doubled and so rose 100% meaning your investment is now worth $200. Altcoin only rose 50% and your investment is now worth $150. 

If you had bought the $100 worth of alt instead of Bitcoin you would incur an opportunity cost of $50.) 

So where you're currently at is essentially a guessing game. Do you think altcoins will outperform bitcoin or do you think bitcoin will outperform alts? It's up to you to decide on that ",0.966,daily_general_discussion_december_22_2017,0.008,0.869,0.123

And it's patent pending (the team collectively holds over 100 patents, and they just publicly stated that they applied for this patent, so there is no doubt from them that this will go through).

Other coins like Vechain or Wabi won't be able to do this because Walton patented it, so they only have the software. They will have to implement their technology through API in the application layer. This is less secure, and more centralized. Walton is also drowning in partnerships with multi-billion dollar companies and has contracts with municipal govts in china.

Public beta will be released in less than 3 days. Coinnest volume just exploded, sending Walton to #2 volume on their exchange, right behind Tron. This is a KRW fiat to crypto exchange. Coinnest pumped Tron over 10x to a 3 billion dollar cap in only 7 days. Koreans are nuts about Walton. The CEO also stated they're in talks with Bittrex, Bithumb, and Bitfinex.

6385,"Look at the bottom price: Alt-usd & alt-btc.
Since both alts and btc are down, you are buying a coin at $0.5 that usually costs $1. When the market recovers, that coin will bounce quickly:)

Bad scenario:
Btc and alts drop 30% and you use btc that you bought at the higher price to get ur alts.

Best scenario:
You buy the btc at the 30% lower price, it recovers and you are lucky enough to buy the 30% lower price altcoin with the now higher value btc.
This happens because fiat money comes in first to btc (or eth, or litecoin or BCC now) then finds its way to alts.

The same scenarios apply to eth, litecoin, bcc instead of btc.

It's a young, volatile market with 24/7 trading where things move at an incredible speed. Even after this most recent dip, BTC is still up more than 12X in the past year and ETH is up 90X. There's violent short term swings, but if you believe in the technology, the 2-5 year horizon is bright imo. 

In June, I saw an article talking about Bitcoin at $3000 after assuming it had died out after the MtGox fiasco. I thought to myself that we MUST be in an unsustainable bubble. Then I read more about how the technology evolved and how the cryptocurrency world had exploded. 

Then BTC hit $7k, $8k and I told make a promise to myself to never be such a pussy ever again. I'm only in with a small, speculative part of my net worth, but I see crypto as a once in a lifetime opportunity. This is like getting into the stock market before institutional money removed all the gems. 

Day-to-Day swings are part of the game when it comes to a risky new asset. If the tech continues to expand its reach, the money will flow in. If it crashes, I'm playing with house money at this point anyway :)",0.9455,daily_general_discussion_december_22_2017,0.055,0.813,0.131

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ektmh/how_do_you_read_the_depth_charts_on_coinbase/

go to GDAX - open up the ""depth chart"" on the top right. That will give you the depth view. As the other poster writes: 

>Where the two lines meet in the center is the current market price. The slope of the green and red lines indicate how much money it would take to move the price a given amount through a market buy or market sell order.
>
>A steeper line indicates it would take more money to move the price a given amount, and a flatter line means it would take less money to move the price the same amount.
>
>When you see a vertical line, that's called a ""wall"". It means that the wall has to be ""eaten"" in order to move the price past the price point the wall is at. For example, there's a buy wall at $286 in your screencap. Buy walls provide price support (harder to drop price past the wall). Sell walls do the opposite (there's a small sell wall at $290.XX), they make it harder to increase the price.

(again do your own research) The one thing they lack is the marketing.

ZenCash has the first real DAO (distributed autonomous organization). Other coins like DASH make use of a treasury with trusted 3rd parties. ZenCash is the first to implement funding through the use of a DAO that runs on the ZenCash protocol.

ZenCash uses secure nodes to mask transactions, making them indistinguishable from normal HTTPS web traffic. Domain fronting also can be used to bypass any restrictions that a country might install to restrict traffic from other countries or regions.

6982,"It sounds like you're being a tad too emotional and since you're still new to this:

Don't put money into this market, that you can't afford to lose. I'm not implying you have, but just incase, since a lot of stories have started popping up about people taking loans and so on. Most projects have a lot of potential and we probably all get carried away by that, but it's still a risky ""investment"". By only putting throwaway money into it, it will also be easier to remain levelheaded when it eventually starts dipping.

Being emotional can easily lead to mistakes, especially when daytrading. Safest course of action is still researching a bit, reading the whitepapers, diversifying in several coins and simply HODL'ing. Trust in the future, not the current price it's valued at. Daytrading doesn't fit a lot of people and most will lose money trying to, but it's still worth trying out for the experience, although best with a small amount of money while learning.

Good luck and have a nice day! As a last note, treat it as a currency, the only way to keep it growing is by spreading the word and convincing others to start accepting it.",0.9945,daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017,0.034,0.711,0.255

7448,"Look at market caps. There are a lot more of XRP in circulation, which decreases the price of an individual unit. However, the market cap is roughly 1/5 of BTC's. If XRP did hypothetically outperform BTC one day, you would only have gotten a 5x increase on your money. Which is great but it's probably not going to make you crazy rich. You look at a low market cap coin with a lot of potential (who is behind developing it, what the coin offers, etc.) and invest in that, you could potentially 400x your investment if you chose the right coin. Right now XRB (RaiBlocks) is 1/380 the market cap of BTC, some some speculate it could replace BTC inevitably. If they're right on that gamble, then their money would be 380x  or more. Also, you should think of investing in cryptocurrency as investing in software.

7450,"I'm also relatively new to this but I think I can answer your question of why smaller coins aren't always better. This all has to do with curculating supply, for example Bitcoin has just under 17 million units that can be purchased and held, whereas another coin such as Ethereum has 96 million units. So if the market cap of both of them were to be equal, you could dump the same amount of money into each but have different anounts of each coin. Hope this helps!",0.3885,daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017,0.068,0.847,0.085
7451,"• More quantity does not necessarily equal a better investment if the rate of increase in market cap of the smaller coin is less than than that of the larger coin (you can see coins' mkt caps here: https://coinmarketcap.com). It may make sense to split investment across several coins to ""diversify"", if you think that your single ""large"" coin investment might underperform. 

• Yes, prolly many millionaires from BTC and other cryptos, but BTC was the first so that's why you hear about it the most.

• The wallet thing, from my understanding, is a security thing... to protect you in the case an exchange gets hacked or otherwise shut down. If you move your coins to wallets where you control the private keys, you would have access to your coins if the exchange went poof. For me, I kinda have faith in coinbase and binance keeping stuff safe so I'm gonna risk it and leave it all on exchanges. Also, I plan to buy and sell shitcoins often so I need that liquidity.

• Another thing about the wallets... you would have to keep the private keys safe somehow (print it, store it in a safe or something) cause if you lose them, your money is pretty much gone.",0.9515,daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017,0.057,0.818,0.125
7452,"Good questions.

Firstly, because of the way each coin is broken down into smaller parts (called satoshis, 1 satoshi = 1/100M of a token.) you don't need to buy a whole coin of anything. Really it's just how much value you put into each coin. So you could easily buy a bunch of small coins, and still buy $500 worth of BTC if you wanted. It's a good idea to diversify between the more established coins (like BTC, ETC, LTC, etc.) as well as the altcoins that have a much larger potential to grow.

So yes, people can easily become millionaires with any of these other coins. In fact, there could be a case made that it might even be easier to become a millionaire with the other coins, as long as you play your cards right. Which is total luck, combined with tracking real news.

The answer to your question about the online wallets is that it depends on how long you want to hold your money in crypto. The wallets make sense if you want to continue to try to gain additional money from what you have in there. Of course, it's risky because you could also lose value, but with the market how it is now it's pretty hard to take losses over the long term. Then when you want to pull money out to make sure it's not as at risk anymore, you would in fact sell to something like coinbase and deposit it into your bank account (assuming at that time there's not an easy way to just spend crypto in the real world, which is imminent).

Hopefully that helps a little with your main questions.

IOTA should make a huge jump too because they just announced that they’re partnering with BOSCH, which is a huge tech company and will definitely open new doors for IOTA and all crypto in terms of companies taking crypto in. I’d stick to the top 10-15 on market sites. XRP is expecting big news any day now, as two “non-bank, household name” partnerships were teased but not yet announced. Also Coinbase adoption is *heavily* expected to be coming soon, which will give it a nice bump. Get in on XRP asap. That’s all I know.

On a side note, you have a good head on you avoiding BTC and BCH, in my opinion. I don’t think a coin that tries to benefit from stealing another coin’s name is going to last long, especially with their leader (BCH), and I think the ship has sailed if you want to make a lot of money in a year on BTC, unless you’re wealthy enough to buy a bunch.

The reason being, your money is not insured and it would be difficult to recover.  When Mt. Gox, a popular Japanese exchange, imploded in 2014, they closed the site and filed for bankruptcy.  

People who had their coins on the exchange were helpless.  Some were able to recover them, but it took a long time and was arduous. 

So it really depends.  Some people keep $500 in BTC or other semi-liquid forms on Binance and other exchanges so they can pounce quickly on a new coin or the beginning of an uptrend. 

But in general, if you're a holder that doesn't move coin much, you're going to be much better served just moving to a wallet.

> Is exchange arbitrage a viable strategy? I’ve been browsing through some exchanges and the differences in price is a bit astounding, over 10% for some currencies. How would one go about buying on one exchange and selling on another? Are there open source algorithms that do this? 

Only with a proprietary bot, otherwise you'll never be fast enough, also take into account any trade fees you'll have to pay.

>What should I️ look for in choosing an exchange? What should I️ avoid? There seems to be a shit ton of shady stuff going on, relative to other investment vehicles. I’m worried I’m going to get fucked. 

Use a popular one that is used by a lot of people, apart from that unfortunately it's still pretty unregulated, so no matter how popular, shit can happen.

Coinbase decides to just randomly, out of the blue, add BCH to their exchange without telling anyone, and the prices of the other 3 coinbase cryptos subsequently tanked, and then prices went haywire for everything including BCH being shown at 9k very briefly. There's panic because there are a lot of potential ramifications at place regarding the BTC/BCH mess, possible insider trading with Coinbase, and now complete unpredictability with what will happen tomorrow at 9am PST when BCH is reopened on Coinbase.

At this point, I think we need to realize that Coinbase is for the [early majority](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/early-majority.asp), not the early adopter or ""pro"". Extremely significant volatility in an altcoin carries legal and political risks for Coinbase as a company in America, as most of the ""dumb money"" flooding cryptocurrency markets these days is coming from Coinbase. Coinbase is protecting their own ass, so mama doesn't come in and invest her redneck ass into the get-rich-quick Roger Ver scheme after hearing about it on CNBC and than near-instantly take a -40% ROI, and then end up with a class-action from some attorney that will take all the proceeds from litigation. Somewhere else down in this thread I posted a bunch of links on Twitter @-replying GDAX support -- *GDAX* support -- where people were like ""I lost my Christmas money"" and shit like that.

The ability to restrict cryptocurrencies at will -- even when supported -- gives Coinbase *massive* market leverage, as they are literally *the* faucet to turn on/off this userbase from alts like BCH. Unfortunately, being a (mostly) unregulated market, it's just something you/we have to live with until a Coinbase competitor with less care about exposing users to risk comes online and gets mindshare (or time on commercial airwaves.)",-0.4588,daily_general_discussion_december_20_2017,0.119,0.77,0.111

8540,"I can give this a stab. Disclaimer, I'm a very active XMR community member, so you should triple check any positive thing I say about XMR and any negative thing I say about Verge.

Monero utilizes three major privacy technologies: Ring signatures, RingCT (Confidential Transactions adapted for Ring Signatures), and Stealth Addresses. There is currently no native support for Tor/I2P trafficking in the wallet, but there are tutorials out there on how to set it up, so it's not impossible currently. The Monero Project is currently working on the Kovri router (C++ implementation of the original I2P router written in Java) though, which will be included natively when it's done.

Verge currently has Tor and I2P integration in their wallets. They are working on adding optional Stealth Addresses (1/3 of the privacy tech Monero already has) which they are calling the 'Wraith Protocol'.

You will find an irreconcilable difference between the way hard-core XMR and XVG people view privacy. So when one group says their privacy is superior, they say it from their point of view of what actually constitutes privacy. This actually comes down to a difference in threat models that goes largely untalked about.

 As an example: Verge claims that if a real person cannot be tracked down (i.e. because IP addresses are not leaked since there is a Tor/I2P integration), then it doesn't matter if amounts can be tracked through the blockchain. The privacy is sufficient for the everyday person who wishes to keep their finances a secret.

On the other hand, Monero thinks that finances should be private from everyone, even governments, and looks at state level actors, sees the kinds of resources available to them (and how many individuals are still caught on the dark web due to various attacks such as sybil or correlation attacks) and realize that there are several attack surfaces that IP obfuscation alone cannot defend against. Even something such as tracking amounts can allow correlations to be made about txs and the people making them. 

In summation, the threat models (in my opinion) are different for the two coins. So when Verge says they have good privacy, it may be true for their threat model (keeping financial info private from third parties like friends, family, or corporations). When Monero says their privacy is better, it may indeed be better for their threat model (state level adversaries) but massive overkill for Verge's threat model.

All that to say, Verge at the moment doesn't have anything that Monero doesn't already have. As stated above, Monero wallets can be configured to route through Tor/I2P (not as easily as Verge admittedly), but Verge doesn't have Ring Signatures, Confidential Transactions, or Stealth Addresses. When Wraith Protocol comes out, they will have the last one, but it's 1 of 3 of Monero's tech. 

Last point (this is already long, I'm sorry). Verge actually embraces the dichotomy of the public transactions that can be created vs the private ones under the future Wraith Protocol, so you can be transparent or private at your leisure. Monero has this too, with the ability to share view keys (not spend keys) so you can be optionally transparent with whomever you like. But ultimately, Verge's transparency will probably lead to a lack of fungibility like most other optionally private blockchain coin (read: pretty much all of them). To see why this is an issue, I defer to [this article](http://cryptoizzy.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-bitcoin-flaw-monero-rising.html).

8632,"It's simple multiplication versus compounding your returns. 

3 x 5 = 15.  Because 15 is a quantity of 3 ""5""s. 

But 2 x 5 = 10.  And then 2 x 10 = 20.  

So 3xing 5,000 would be 15,000.  

4xing 5,000 would be 20,000. 

All you're doing is multiplying.  But if you multiply once, and then multiply the product of that equation, you've changed the equation.

Multiplying is what it says: I have ""5"" (100%), I want to make *three* groups of ""5"" ( 5 x 3, or increasing your 100% to 300% ), and now taken as a whole, I have ""15"".  But it is all done at once.  

You aren't saying, ""Ok, add one group of ""5"" (5 x 2), and then, *multiply* that *entire* group by another 2 (10 x 2), because now you've changed the ""group"", i.e, the thing you were originally multiplying. 

If you think about it as something not divisible, i.e, apples, if helps you visualize. 

So, I have one apple in a basket.  I want to increase my apples 300%.  So I put two more apples in the basket. 

The ""apple"" is the same as the ""5"".  When you're multiplying, you're multiplying that exact quantity, so you can't do it in a chain, because if you did, it would be changing that original quantity you had set out to multiply in the first place.",0.7783,daily_general_discussion_december_20_2017,0.0,0.953,0.047

If you are paying more than 5 dollars in transfer fees, then I would suggest waiting with transfers until you can keep the fee down. Don't stop buying, just don't transfer every newly bought fraction of bitcoin immediately. This way, you can keep the transaction costs down. Don't leave everything on the exchange though, but let it accumulate to a certain threshold, and then withdraw it.

You are balancing the risk of the exchange against the cost of transacting. Since that cost is quite high at the moment, it probably outweighs instant withdrawal to reduce risk. (but it is something you have to decide for yourself.)",-0.0083,daily_general_discussion_december_20_2017,0.035,0.91,0.055

If I send 150$ worth of BTC to my aunt, the miners will process it, and the ledger is open, everyone can see it. That's why it's decentralized. There's no central BTC Bank who makes all the transactions

Coinbase is by far the easiest entry point for most into crypto, so by adding support to buy/sell/trade BCH it makes it more accessible to the masses.

9139,"I've been debating doing something like this myself and I think my biggest hold up right now is the fact that I can't help but look at the burst in growth of bitcoin as a rare freak case that is unstable and will most likely drop as soon as the hype of ""get rich fast"" excitement fades off. And if bitcoin drops, the rest of alt coins will too. I foresee a future with more of ""a few very powerful alt coins growing from practically out of nowhere because of coordinated ""pump and dump"" schemes"", and less of ""every alt coin rising by hundred percent increases by the week"". 

It's probably a reasonable bet to spread thin hoping that one of the alt coins gets a big burst, thus accounting for the losses in the rest of the coins, but the problem is there's just no guarantee that the one that is going to skyrocket to the moon is going to be in the top 100. It could be any of the top 500. It just takes a few agents coordinating for it to happen. 

I mean, if you go to a roulette and put one chip in EVERY number, you are going to lose money. You may think cryptos are different because the amount that you are going to make out of the one currency that rises up is going to compensate for the rest, but that's ONLY if the current market continues the absolutely balls to the wall exponential rise it's seeing right now, and there's just no guarantees that is going to happen. February 2018 we could all be looking at bitcoin sitting at 6k and the rest of the alt coins crashing down. 

If you don't mind losing those 15000 dollars (you mean spending 100 on each, right?), then sure.

Not since the invention of the Internet itself has there been such a controversial technological creation as Bitcoin. Bitcoin's early pioneers sought to blur the lines of sovereignty and the financial status quo. After years of underground development, Bitcoin grabbed the attention of a curious public – as well as the ire of the regulators the technology had subverted. Yet after landmark arrests of prominent cyber criminals, Bitcoin, which actually surged on election night, still faces its most severe adversary, the very banks it was built to destroy.

I'm relatively new to cryptocurrency as well, but I learned most of what I know through research on Reddit. I like to surf through this subreddit and visit the subreddits of coins that are mentioned here. For example, if I see a mention of BTC, I'll visit the BTC subreddit. By doing this, I learn about the different types of coins, use cases of each one, and why people are invested in the coin (what technologies are valuable).

It's probably not the answer you're looking for, but this is just one perspective.

Also if you're new, may I suggest you to register for coinbase now and make your first deposit. Since this can take upwards of 10 days, so by the time you've researched enough, you'll be able to start buying right away.

The reason I'm suggesting LTC is because it's the fastest and cheapest to transfer between exchanges, among the options you have available in Coinbase/GDAX.

Also, I'm not certain but GDAX may charge a lower fee for transferring between exchanges than Coinbase does, and it absolutely charges smaller fees for buying the LTC in the first place. Could be wrong about the former point, though. If you don't know how to use GDAX don't worry, it's very simple. Google GDAX, go to the site, choose LTC/USD from the drop-down menu at the top left and click on the Deposit button in the same area. Put all your USD into GDAX from Coinbase (the relevant tab should be obvious), place a limit or market order for LTC and then Withdraw it to whatever exchange you're using to buy your alts.

9340,"Others have different answers.

> The first being why was bitcoin created?

Nakamoto, Finney, Szabo et al. were primarily [cypherpunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk). Cryptocurrency allows for a currency to exist outside the control of an existing nation-state, and has been an active area of research for decades in ""hacker"" circles.

> Aside from the get rich stigma it seems to have, why should I put money into a crypto currency versus some sort of traditional investment?

High risk, high reward. Cryptocurrencies are exceptionally volatile. As an investor that doesn't give a shit, you can make a lot of money or lose it all. If you want to stay uneducated about the cryptocurrency space, stay out of it. Stick your money into some Vanguard ETFs and call it a day. You will make a return and not lose your ass gambling on a get rich quick scheme.

> What is the goal of crypto currency creators?

This depends on the creator of the specific currency. Some have political goals. Some *say* they have goals, and in reality are just trying to get a lot of stupid people to buy into their coin as a veiled pump-and-dump scheme.

> And if after doing more research about crypto currency, how would I decide which crypto currenc(ies)y I should invest in?

You'll find that out. I've been studying cryptocurrencies and messed around with them since 2011. I first read about Bitcoin [on the cryptography mailing list Satoshi published on](http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html). At the time, I found it interesting, but not really anything world-changing.

> Any and all useful answers are welcome! Keep in mind I’m a freshman in college studying biology and truly have no business in a complex economic place like the crypto currency market but I would love to learn about it and potentially invest money so that in the future I’m not utterly fucked by debt

You don't need that much training to figure this out. It's mostly wild, unregulated, and people chasing pipe dreams.

From what I've seen of the most consistently referred to and traded coins, my guess would be (pending these coins having any desire to work with Coinbase after this fiasco):

- XRP Ripple (More consistently regulated, as it's used by banks)
- IOTA (Internet of Things is growing exponentially)
- DASH (One of the more consistent coins over the last couple years)

by diversifying among the big boys, you are investing in the crypto market in general, which we all know will be going up in the medium-long term.

you can gamble on lower-cap alts like REQ with the remainder of your folio to try and get huge returns, but by keeping most of your money in the top 10, you will see steady and impressive profit. it will definitely not be boring!

So far President Trump has been very focused on job creation and growth of US GDP. The creation of blockchain technologies and companies, in my opinion will only benefit from his administration.

The one form of currencies that I would be concerned about is pure privacy tokens. You know that the government is not going to allow people to be ‘unmonitored.’ 

I imagine all currencies will be backed to an IP address or some form of identification, this might even flow over into digital wallets as well. 

Proper government regulations will bring a lot of money and recognition into this ecosphere.

Start with researching the history of BTC. Then do some reading on ETH. After that I'd check out LTC, NEO, VEN, REQ... all the top 20 coins. Figure which ones are competitors of each other. Figure out which ones are winning in their fields. Figure out what the strengths of each are. Make a list. Make a summary of the purpose of each. Is the coin anonymous? Is it decentralized? Is it based on ETH or is it an entirely new blockchain? What is its market cap? How strong is the team? How strong is their marketing? Do they have an actual working product yet?

If you have an Iphone, there is an app called ""Crypto Pro"". It cost $4.99 but it allows you to pick all of the coins you have in your portfolio, and it gives you summaries of your profit total, profit total in 24hr, and has all sorts of goodies (charts/info/news). Best app I have ever gotten.

I originally had an excel sheet I would update with each new price, and it would spit out my total profit, but I had to manually look up the prices and update each one.. not fun when you have 10 cryptos

The app works by allowing you to add cryptos to your ""favorites"".

The amount someone has is just a number in the blockchain.

That someone is a private key and that number is in an address. The address is derived from the private key. It's asymmetric cryptography. 

When someone sends you a coin, they add a TX that deducts the amount from the sending address, and adds that amount to your address. The sender then creates a signature with their private key which is nonreputable. The network can guarantee the sender has permission to move numbers from their address to yours.

So you don't receive anything. There is simply a transaction that says an address has a number in a ledger everyone agrees to. The fact you can produce a signature with your private key tells the network you own that number.

It is of course more complicated than this.

NEO shouldn't be one of those coins you buy hoping for a moon so you can divest.  I mean, it *may* do that, but NEO is truly a ""HOLD"" coin.  Because of the dividends you get paid. 

If you want to play the long game, I'd say it would be very wise to invest large in NEO now, while it's relatively cheap.  WHen people start realizing how it works, and the dividend it pays, it's going to jump dramatically. 

Your GAS you generate will increase in value too, and since your NEO will be paying you out dividends, you can exchange your GAS for BTC or cash, and your NEO can keep generating it. 

And if you're looking for moonshots, you'd probably be better off just investing in GAS itself, because that's the true ""currency"" of NEO, and that's what you're going to cash out in.

If I had another 5k to put into cyrpto right now, for sure at least half of that would go straight to NEO.  But again, it's not going to be like other cryptos you pick up.

Just like the internet it took businesses a decade and a half to really begin utilizing that tool. I think we'll see the same trend with cryptocurrencies. I actually don't think bitcoin will be around for the long haul. It's just not flexible enough. I do believe bitcoin will be around for another two decades. It will eventually be beat out by newer advancements. I still can't figure out how banks are going to try and regulate it since it really falls under no countries jurisdiction.

10193,"I've heard many different blockchain metaphors, and yours makes sense to me.

It's simplest to use Bitcoin as the example to answer your questions:

> And how was it initially distributed?

Satoshi Nakomoto mined a few blocks of Bitcoin for himself and told some friends who started to get in on the network.  From there, more and more people joined in.  Obviously, the earlier adopters got more Bitcoin as the network difficulty was still low and it was easier to mine.

> how did they determine the initial value of it?

Even though this is a very cliche statement to use, it was only worth what someone else was willing to pay for it.  My guess is that early on, the miners used electricity cost as a base value for selling their bitcoin.  For example, if it cost them $100 to mine a Bitcoin, maybe they would sell it for $120.  A 20% premium to help pay for equipment.  Of course, one Bitcoin was far cheaper and who knows how much of a premium the miners gave themselves.

I'm in Monero XMR and I'm in it for the long-term. Many Monero owners have a similar strategy and it has a grassroots following, meaning that its bottoms are likely stronger than those of other cryptos where the buyers are only it for the quick profit and not the passion.

Also its sourcecode algorithm will follow the same pattern as Bitcoin, atleast until 2022. So we have a long way to go up, with relatively strong grassroots bottoms.

I'm surprised you don't hold BTC? It's clearly the best coin in my view (brand, security, dev team, API network etc). Scaling, Bcash etc yes, but I still like it a lot.

I also like XRP because it adds diversity to all crypto portfolios. The very reason people don't like it, is the reason I like it. It's more government and bank friendly - while that's not in the spirit of crypto it offers something to your portfolio that others won't be able to offer.

IOTA had a very solid run and is a large part of your portfolio. If it was me, I would re-weight IOTA when adding new cryptos.

I'm in XBY but I have serious concerns that it could be a vaporware. It's a really difficult one for me. Obviously the returns are large if they prove the tech. The key issue is the code is not disclosed yet and the governance is poor/opaque (devs are not public and we don't know any details about the reported pending patent).

11010,"Hi, Perhaps my sory is of interest to you. 
I was lucky enough to buy 1 bitcoin in 2014. Didn't look at it until November, but two weeks ago, I decided to sell some of it and diversify my holdings. I took some stakes in a number of coins with large market caps, such as ETH, LTC, Ripple and IOTA, which I think makes sense. But, like you, I also wanted to make some investments in smaller coins which, I believe (and hope), have more upward potential.

Some of my picks are: DENT (bandwith for mobile phones) DNA (genetic data) POET (intellectual property protection) CRED (anti spam solution) HAT (crypto currency exchange) PAYX (payment platform) GVT (platform for private trust management)

As you can see, I'm trying to only pick coins which use blockchain technology for some clear functional business perspective (not coins which pitch themselves as a new digital currency, i.e. ""the new bitcoin""). I also look on their websites for info on their team, partners and roadmap.

I'm not an expert in altcoins, but I think my strategy makes sense. I also do not expect mega-returns in days or weeks, but believe that there is huge potential in the medium to longer run. Let me know what you think.

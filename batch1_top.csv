Right now he's just giving an overview of price moments, what are ICOs, etc

**UPDATE** He wants to look into those conducting crypto currency scams, including scam ICOs!! Hearing the SEC say they want to pursue that brings some confidence to the scene as a whole imo

Senator Brown clearly is in love with crypto but wants the SEC to implement lessons learned from the dot com bust to protect American investors and fix ""gaps in regulation"" in crypto.

Chairman Clayton of the SEC testifies now, explaining ICOs in simple terms ""as I would present the idea to a mainstreet investor"" and what the block chain is. Most of his speech is about ICOs and the issues with them, how he wants them regulated like securities and follow the same rules or conduct an actual IPO. ""Those who play linguistic gymnastics to label their initial stock offering as a ""coin"" are placing themselves squarely within the crosshairs of our enforcement division"". To sum up, the SEC wants to embrace crypto but only if its allowed to oversee and enforce regulations to protect investors.

Chairman Ciancarlo of the SEC testifying now, sharing personal story about trying to get his kids invested in stocks at a young age and they couldn't care less, but now they are all obsessed with bitcoin and crypto. ""we owe it to this new generation to respect their enthusiasm about crypto with a thoughtful and balance response, not a dismissive one. But also crack down hard on those who try to abuse that enthusiasm with fraud and manipulation"" He is also focusing on his partner's previous statements, enforcement of regulations and tracking down and prosecuting fraudsters.

To be honest its a little weird actually watching all these government suits talking about things I've really only been able to talk about online. Crypto is here to stay and more mainstream than we think, even if it seems like you're the only crypto enthusiast you know in real life.

Chairman Graco responds, ""I've had the same conversations with my kids and you're right, their enthusiasm is wonderful"". . . . ""Should Congress address revising and refining our financial law so a group of agencies can have sufficient jurisdiction to regulate this?""

Clayton, ""I think we may, I think we may""

Graco, ""Then you need to get together and tell us exactly what the SEC has jurisdiction over at this moment in crypto and what you're capable of enforcing so we know where to start""

The SEC then responds they basically have no jurisdiction. They remind people all the official looking exchanges they trade on online that look like the stock market are completely unbacked and unregulated and are very risky. Now they're going back and forth about how they can regulate the international nature of this market.

Brown, ""How much of that 4 billion raised in ICOs last year was raised in the U.S.?"" Not clear, but a significant enough portion we should be paying attention.

Now a senator is asking the SEC where the bottom is because he doens't see an intrinsic value or liquidity in holding coins. Ciancarlo is explaining the costs of mining are what originally was used to give bitcoin extrinsic value.

Clayton, very carefully agreeing that he also doesn't know what the value of crypto really is but you can tell he doesn't want to FUD it, ""What somethings worth is what someone's willing to pay for it"". ""I believe at the heart of it something is there that guarantees a floor, I'm just not seeing it manifest in the market yet""

Now they're discussing how the proliferation of alt coins and how many are outright fradulent. Talking about a case they prosecuted against My Big Coin where they found they were just taking the money and buying furniture and stuff. ""We want to pursue frauds because it can have negative emotional effects throughout the market.""

**SEC's Giancarlo just explained the HODLR meme to a room of senators.** 

Senators asking what can the SEC do to combat pump and dumps. SEC ""Senators when you have an unregulated exchange the ability to manipulate prices goes up.""",0.9876,daily_general_discussion_february_6_2018,0.076,0.797,0.127

Please remember this the next time the market crashes.  Remember how silly the despair looks in hindsight.  Look back a year from now to realize how silly these day-to-day fluctuations are in retrospect. 

I had people telling me the bubble had burst, that it was all downhill from there, that this *proved* that all coins were about to go to a zero value. 

This is a *long game* people.  Don't *help* the bad actors spread the FUD.  Just sit back, relax, **don't put more money in than you're willing to lose**, and buy the dip. 

If you bought NEO when it went to $60 last night, you'd be up almost 80% on your investment *the next fucking day*. 

Have some god damn perspective.

Unless we hear news that all of blockchain is compromised and going to be replaced by *better* technology, dips are *solely* emotional.  They aren't' pragmatic.  People liquidate on emotion.  Then they come back when they see green.  And the ones who *start* the green are institutional investors who will *gladly* lap up all the discounts at super cheap prices. 

We've seen this four times now just *this month* and still people *keep falling for it*.  Now that people see green, they're throwing their money back in.  The time to buy is when everything is red.  When everyone's panicking. 

The more I see people throwing emotional tanrums on this subreddit, the more I invest.  It's almost a perfect rule-of-thumb for investing.

1372,"Here are the FACTS:

•There’s ramped up regulatory oversight and potential government crackdowns forcing many holders to exit positions. 

•Tax implications rearing it’s ugly head.

•The market has also been on a euphoric ride, with the run gaining too much momentum as latecomers look to get in on the action - a sure sign of a bubbling asset. 

•BTC transactions per second a major drawback, along with a mining community that has been less willing to process transactions due to the lower fees. 

•Massive downturn in sentiment as people on mass are getting seriously burned.

•Bitconnect left scars and new investors will be VERY weary of investing based on this clever scam and the huge sell offs that accompany the slightest bit of negativity

So when looking at the following FACTS: 

*High transaction fees, slow transfer times, lack of ability to truly innovate/scale once established (hence all the other Cryptos), inevitable regulation getting stricter and tighter, tax implications, exchange shenanigans occurring, bubble mentality which every man and his dog is now aware of, the hype is now well established and CLEARLY dissipating as fear sets in etc.*

Do you honestly think that the Pokemon Go style hype is going to come back and suddenly lift cryptos right back up to pre-crash levels anytime soon? Come on.

So my investment has been quite a mix of alts and some btc,,, I’ve seen £25k develop to £78k shrink expand and now it looks pretty dire as we sit at around £21k.
It’s hard to imagine a return to the high price we have been used to but according to the experts we will retrace to the top, well let’s hope they are right as I do not see it happening from my past experience, I do see money flowing back in but will be into other emerging blockchain tech and not the old school stuff

To be more precise it’s 350€ I want to spend but I’m not sure if it’s better to split it up over my portfolio to increase all my positions or do I stack up on one currency.

I want coins/tokens with promising futures, partnerships, an actual use in tomorrows world (no shilled shitcoins). And yes I will do my own research on all suggestions as I always do.

I was thinking OMG, V3N, WTC, ETH (even though I believe ETH will be outdone performance wise by 3rd gen cryptos unless sharding comes fast - I believe it'll blow back up when we finally reach the bottom due to first mover advantage & possible flippening), maybe GNT?... what others am I missing - quick description would be good too?

Let's do something about it. We have finished building an exchange with direct fiat-coin pairs. We started with an OTC business, and got started building the exchange after BOTH our liquidity provider and our bank account got shut down (sigh, DBS/Gemini).

The exchange is called [NuMoney Exchange](https://exchange.numoney.store). And we are launching with physical stores (2 in Singapore, 1 in Malaysia, 1 in Indonesia), and we will support 3 local currencies — Singapore dollars, Indonesian Rupiah and Malaysian Ringgit.

Think of us as Gemini + Binance. Gemini for fiat deposits/withdrawals, Binance because we will support as many coin pairs as we can.

We also built the exchange to be resistant to bank shutdowns. How? We have engaged cash-vault services, just like a bank. Cash in, cash out.

As an international user, you can and should arbitrage the insane buy-side demand here (higher selling prices).

We will be launching after Chinese New Year (Feb 16th)! Most of it is already built.

These major drops have left extremely deep wounds for people.

There COULD be a couple of shiners that rise to the top after all this, that then become the most stable and sort after ‘safe heavens’ when times get tough... but just look at the sea of red and high % drawdown on accounts. 

SO...

In my opinion, the hay day of crypto currency trading as it once was is dead. Even if tech improve substantially, new Cryptos surface, things start improving, wounds are just far too deep to rise to pre-crash levels anytime soon. 

The hype has clearly dissipated into TOO MUCH heightened fear and HODLing on for dear life - this is NOT what investing is about. This is hoping out of pure fear. 

Do you think George Soros holds and hopes out of fear when an investment goes sour? No. He fucking assesses the viability and if there is none - bails. Then moves onto the next high probable opportunity to ensure his equity is ripe and consistently growing.

Those that think the Cryptos they’re HODLing are going to get back to breakeven or pre-crash levels are living in dream land. Unfortunately, this is the hard truth. The fundamentals for Cryptos are very bad at the moment and likely to get worse. 

I anticipate BTC getting to $3000 before getting anywhere near $12,000.

1959,"People are wondering how the price of bitcoin and all associated alts keeps dropping through perceived 'support', support being defined as where past money flowed in the most.

When the Internet bubble burst 18 years ago, a roughly 3 month long event, talking heads on CNBC would always ponder why traditional support wasn't holding. It wasn't until later in the game that the talking heads figured out it was the high percentage of ESOP shares handed out. ESOPs had been used for years, especially in Silicone Valley. In 1990 ESOPs were only handed out to key employees, by 1997, Silicone Valley was really starting to rock, and most employment offers included stock options.

Options usually had a vesting schedule, typically 25% a year, often it took 4 years of employment to fully vest. Silicone Valley was an extremely robust investment hotbed since the 70's. Nothing crazy, no bubble, but strong steady growth with the inevitable ups and downs.

Many of the big names that would explode during the bubble had been handing out stock options for years. Typically the option price was 80% of the market price on some day prior. Typically, if you were granted stock options in a company prior to 1999, with a strike price of 80% of fair market value, you became a paper millionaire in 2000.

Even if you didn't get sign on stock options, you definitely had access to a 401K and 100% employer match, with if you put 10% of your income in your companies stock, the company would kick an equal amount. If you started worked in Silicone valley in 1990, put 10% of your income into your company's stock, and they matched 100%, and that company bubbled, 4 million net worth was not unheard of, for mid level engineers!

For the most part, this sudden wealth was unexpected by most.

Well, today there are no crypto ESOPs, but there are the developers and very early adopters, those are the guys who hold a lot of the bitcoin with cost bases way below $7000, sort of like the unexpected millionaires of 2000. Like it did 18 years ago, it's their selling that is blowing away tradition notions of price support, like it did to a much lesser extent during the Internet bubble.",0.991,daily_general_discussion_february_5_2018,0.019,0.858,0.123

""We are entering a new digital era in world financial markets. As we saw with the development of the Internet, we cannot put the technology genie back in the bottle. Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. Ignoring these developments will not make them go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response. The evolution of these assets, their volatility, and the interest they attract from a rising global millennial population demand serious examination. With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight and private sector innovation, new technologies will allow American markets to evolve in responsible ways and continue to grow our economy and increase prosperity.

From the Conclusion:
>Through the years, technological innovations have improved our markets, including
through increased competition, lower barriers to entry and decreased costs for market
participants. Distributed ledger and other emerging technologies have the potential to further
influence and improve the capital markets and the financial services industry. Businesses,
especially smaller businesses without efficient access to traditional capital markets, can be aided
by financial technology in raising capital to establish and finance their operations, thereby
allowing them to be more competitive both domestically and globally. And these technological
innovations can provide investors with new opportunities to offer support and capital to novel
concepts and ideas. 

This all looks good to me.  SEC looks really open to this and not looking to squash crypto at all.

This was the [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7o9bqw/daily_general_discussion_january_5_2018/ds8hsod/) in the daily discussion on January 5th. I've highlighted the first two paragraphs that haven't rung truer than right now. You can read the rest of it but the first two paragraphs were quite impressive to me.

>To address a lot of the worrying things I'm seeing in this thread from complete investing newbies...

>If you aren't prepared for the price to go down, 40, 60, or even 100% then you should not be invested in cryptocurrencies, let alone risky small cap investments. If you want to play in this space you have to be absolutely sure that when you see this happen, you don't panic, evaluate the situation as a whole, and remember what the goals of your trade were in the first place. This is partially why it's so important to invest in stuff you believe in and understand...when the weather gets bad you want to make sure you can withstand the storm because you believe it will end eventually. And if you fancy yourself a day trader, then before you get into a trade make sure you have set goals and stop losses, otherwise your floundering with no plan.

>If you're putting money in thinking it's just always going to go up. Days like this are normal in all markets, and while it sucks to feel like you're losing money the ultimate lesson an investor can learn is patience. Because it seems to me many of the people who post here have never invested in other markets and expect everything to go up 100% a week. Crypto moves faster than any market, and what seems like a disaster today could be completely forgotten in three.

I was thinking about making a daily post taking top posts from a month ago (if its well received, otherwise i'll just do it in the daily discussion).

I appeared in the car park of the nearest supermarket to me (not from US). Everyone was running around screaming about how this was the end, and that they need to cash out now before it's too late. People were frantically buying trolleys worth of food, and cars were screeching around the parking lot. It was mental.

> From a financial regulatory perspective, these developments may
enable us to better monitor transactions, holdings and obligations (including credit exposures) and other activities and characteristics of our markets, thereby facilitating our regulatory mission, including, importantly, investor protection.

>At the same time, regardless of the promise of this technology, those who invest their hard-earned money in opportunities that fall within the scope of the federal securities laws deserve the full protections afforded under those laws. This ever-present need comes into focus

2203,"This is what I wrote 10 days ago: 

> Okay guys - this might be downvoted but I think this is solid advice so here goes: 

> We've seen for the last couple of weeks that everytime the market starts trending upwards, even for a few hours, it's followed by a giant dump. This has been happening without fail, each time, everytime. 

> So, if we want this roller-coaster to stop, there's only one thing to do: stop buying. Now hold on, before downvoting, hear me out. So, it's evident that we still haven't found the true floor yet - there are still people who are willing to sell at the smallest jumps (bots do too, but they're not holders anyway). So, for us to start rising again, we need to first find rock bottom - a market cap where everyone who is scared has already withdrawn and new speculators are very wary of coming in. We need to get to a stage where a lot of people are pessimistic about gains - in this situation, the only people that go in will be be long term holders who won't sell at the whiff of the slightest bad new and who won't buy a shitcoin simple because ""it's cheap"".

> This will reduce volatility and slowly but surely, we would have 'moved up' the bottom. The market will trade sideways for a while, yes, but this will be better in the longer term.


To that, I added this 3 days back

> I still stand by everything I said - we need have proper pessimism like we had during the China FUD. We need to shake away all weak hand that sell at the whiff of a bad news and buy in every bull trap. We need to reduce volatility as much as possible and trade sideways at $300B - $400B levels for a month or more. Only then - once the ""floor"" becomes rock solid - we'll be able to sustain the next leg up. The relative stability of the market will bring in a lot of new institutional money (remember Novogratz?) which will make the markets more efficient, less prone to manipulation by FUD and less volatile overall. That's how we'll progress, not through the December-like hype train. 


I'm starting to see the pessimism now. The comments in the thread have decreased. People have started to lose hope. The shills are gone. That said, there are still people who are optimistic that markets will increase. They're still buying. Know this: we would have hit bottom when you don't see a single post about buying. When everyone is hopeless and when all people have decided that it's better to get out at a loss than to wait. It's then, when there are no sellers in the market, when the market has traded flat for a few weeks is when we would have hit bottom. We're not there yet  - still a couple more weeks while we trade in the 300B to 400B band. Then, if there isn't any more market wide FUD, we'll start to see slow growth. My estimate is Feb end to mid March. That is when *I'll* be buying. 

Best of luck, boys and girls and I'll see you on the other side.

2) All holders of this coin have been punished for the response of one moderator.

3) It is one of the most promising projects in crypto and its legitimate news should still be posted be posted. 

4) Its formal rebrand is this month and should be allowed to get the attention that the creators of the coin/company deserve.

As such, I recommend the following compromises. 

A) Reduce the time of the silencing to one full week instead of one month. 

B) More actively moderate posts about this coin rather than putting in a ban. 

C) **News about this coin that is considered valid and truthful should still be posted during this period, yet since the moderators have stopped community input, the onus should then fall on them to create the topics.**

It's okay to say crash. It means you're not in some fantasy HODL meme land. People are being convinced to sell at losses because they think it's going to get worse and never recover. That's where we are right now, and that's why it's a crash.

2685,">Conclusion

>Through the years, technological innovations have improved our markets, including
through increased competition, lower barriers to entry and decreased costs for market
participants. Distributed ledger and other emerging technologies have the potential to further
influence and improve the capital markets and the financial services industry. Businesses,
especially smaller businesses without efficient access to traditional capital markets, can be aided
by financial technology in raising capital to establish and finance their operations, thereby
allowing them to be more competitive both domestically and globally. And these technological
innovations can provide investors with new opportunities to offer support and capital to novel
concepts and ideas.

>History, both in the United States and abroad, has proven time and again that these
opportunities flourish best when pursued in harmony with our federal securities laws. These
laws reflect our tripartite mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets
and facilitate capital formation. Being faithful to each part of our mission not in isolation, but
collectively, has served us well. Said simply, we should embrace the pursuit of technological
advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising, but not at the expense
of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and
markets.

>Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today and for your support of the
Commission and its workforce. I stand ready to work with Congress on these issues and look
forward to answering your questions. 

I'd say that seems pretty damn positive. This is going to be a good thing for us. ",0.9928,daily_general_discussion_february_5_2018,0.039,0.747,0.214

2783,"Well, the market can't keep dropping forever. There are two possibilities:

1. The market rebounds aggressively and unexpectedly.
2. The market keeps dropping and eventually reaches an equilibrium which, it then slowly starts to recover from.

In the case of 1), the only option is HODL--timing the market will be too difficult, and we don't know what to look for. In the case of option 2), you should wait for equilibrium and buy then. There will be no need for FOMO because we described it as a slow (rather than aggressive) recovery. 

The strategy is clear: HODL an amount you feel safe losing, and make sure you have a source of funds available when the market normalizes.  Unironically, with this setup, neither 1) nor 2) make you want to kill yourself. ",-0.5994,daily_general_discussion_february_5_2018,0.099,0.815,0.086

2920,"As someone who has not invested at all in crypto (though I work in IT in the financial sector, so it should be in my wheelhouse) I am really curious about something here.

On this thread, and in all sorts of places, people are saying ""the floor is x"", ""it can't drop below Y"", ""once it gets to Z it will be a great buy"". My question is: why?

This is fundamentally why over the last 5 years I have never pulled the trigger on bitcoin or any of the alt-coins. I have been paying attention, and I could have made a shit ton of money, but I just never understood the fundamentals of the investment, never understood why it was at $60, let alone $20k, aside from pure and unadulterated speculation.

So, to anyone with a ""floor"" or a price target they think bitcoin will reach in 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, etc: please tell me what your numbers are based off of? Even if you don't want to give away some proprietary valuation formula, what numbers even went in to your calculations that spat out a value? What are your assumptions? Where will bitcoin have to be in terms of market adoption before your calculations are correct?

Let me try to be more specific as an example (that's super simplified on purpose, but I'd accept even this level of math). Let's say I think that Bitcoin is going to become THE primary method of e-commerce in the next, say, 5 years. Now, it won't be a store of value so much as something you use for transactions only, so you buy bitcoin, use it for Amazon purchases, then Amazon sells their bitcoin for fiat at the end of every day. 

Now, the average american spends $500 a year online, so let's say that on average, every man, woman and child has $500 in bitcoin at any given time, so they only have to re-up from fiat once a year-ish. That's about 150  billion in bitcoin market cap. Now let's triple it, and say instead of 300 million people (Americans) using it, there are almost a billion worldwide, with an average of $500 in bitcoin at any one time. That takes us to a $450 Billion dollar market cap. 

Now, that is a pretty optimistic view (within 5 years) but at least it's something, that points to a market cap target. So I could say ""if you believe all of the above, then the appropriate price for bitcoin is going to be $26k each"" or some such.

It’s the efficient market hypothesis at work. You don’t have to believe in the EMH, just like you don’t have to believe in gravity. It will eventually force itself on you.

Also, there are two enormous factors working against you...

If you day trade, you will be subject to taxes every time you sell a gain. This is the biggest killer that people seem to ignore. Every time you cash out a gain, the gov takes a bite, due at the end of year. If you cash out a loss, you can deduct against your gains, but if you have a loss, the gov isn’t going to send you a check to compensate for a portion of your losses. This tax consequence puts trading in a highly -EV territory.

Also, the transactional fees and spread will kill you in the long run, no matter how small; even if the spread is only a penny.

 For others, understand that the market can't build up forever.
Think of it like this. If I were to build a tower, the higher I built this tower, the more easily it would be knocked down without proper support. **This** is exactly what happened. We went up way too fast and the support wasn't there. Sure you can see it as a bad thing, but I choose to see it as a good thing. The public is now aware of what crypto could potentially be. News networks have picked up on it. AS SOON as this things starts gaining traction, I'm incredibly confident that things are going yo fucking rollllllll.

Especially to all you new people. This is the PERFECT opportunity to get in on some cryptos that you originally 'missed the boat' on because you just came late. If not that, there are an absolutely crazy fucking amount of coins that are now undervalued as shit. There was a massacre in the streets and there is blood everywhere. This is where money is made. This is where you should be booting up your computer and looking into new projects/doubling down on current portfolios. 

**THIS** is the time when you should be looking to invest. Think of the entire market as an individual crypto. Let's name the market Dickcoin. If dickcoin has been constantly pumping for a month straight and is now 10x it's price a month ago, is now the time you would want to buy? No. Any reasonable investor, no matter the fomo or urge to buy in,  would wait for a dip. This is the dip you all asked for, and the crypto gods gave you a fuckin dip with your dip and some dip on the side. Be thankful you can buy in at such low prices. Markets don't only consist of bull runs and you should learn how to work in a bear run too.

deVere officially launches cryptocurrency app with bold Bitcoin predictions

Despite cryptocurrencies tanking over the last month, demand for them will “sky rocket” in the next 12 months, Bitcoin could gain by 50 to 60 per cent, and will remain highly volatile as it comes under “increasing pressure” from Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.
 
These are the bold predictions from Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, one of the world’s largest independent financial services organisations, as today his firm officially launches deVere Crypto, a pioneering cryptocurrency app.
 
Available for Apple and Android, it allows users to store, transfer and exchange currently three major cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum and LiteCoin.  More cryptocurrencies will be added in the coming weeks as the deVere Crypto Research Department, run by some of the world’s leading blockchain experts, analyses their inherent values.
 
Mr Green comments: “Bitcoin – the world’s highest profile and largest by market-cap cryptocurrency - slumped by 30 per cent last week. There’s increasing scrutiny of the market by governments around the world, plus enhanced regulation. Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that some have questioned the timing of the official launch of deVere Crypto.
 
“However, demand for cryptocurrencies is set to sky rocket in 2018 as more people get to know about them and use them, and as the interest of governments and businesses, and more regulation, demonstrate how the market is maturing and becoming ever-more mainstream.”
 
He continues: “Bitcoin will remain highly volatile over the next 12 months, which should be expected.  When it recovers from its current position and if/when it climbs pass the next major resistance point, we could see it surge by 50 to 60 per cent, as many will jump in for fear of missing out for a second time.
 
“As in all markets, this expected volatility is creating, and will continue to create, important buying opportunities.”
 
He goes on to add: “Bitcoin will come under increasing pressure from other cryptocurrencies in 2018, as the rivals up their game and as the similarities and differences become better known.
 
“Ethereum will put the squeeze on Bitcoin the hardest, with many analysts saying Ethereum is supported by superior technology and has more uses than the current dominant leader.
 
“In many ways, the Bitcoin vs Ethereum battle is reminiscent of the VHS vs Betamax tech format war of the 1980s. But there is room for several major players in cryptocurrencies, unlike in the video format market.”
 
The deVere CEO concludes: “deVere Crypto is designed to meet the growing need and want to store and transfer digital currencies in a digital age.  We expect 50,000 downloads this year"".",0.9118,daily_general_discussion_february_5_2018,0.04,0.891,0.069

By the end of last year, Bitcoin and other virtual currencies were hitting all time highs. Everyone was expecting this year to continue the huge rise in prices, but unfortunately this has not been the case at all, and we have seen a huge crash. This has been down to a number of different reasons, mainly being the introduction of stricter regulations and in the case of some countries, the banning of them completely.

There are still a few though who have performed well so far this year, and we feel these might shock you.

Stellar (XLM):

Stellar has had a great January, despite suffering some major knockbacks. The price grew by a whopping 20,000% in 2017, and this has just continued throughout this past month.

Some of this success has come from the formation of partnerships with some very high profile partnerships, with firms like IBM. The introduction onto various trading platforms has also made it more accessible to investors.

NEO (NEO):

Neo Cryptocurrency Logo on a Sunflower Outside

In many ways, NEO is similar to Ethereum. It acts as a platform where applications can be built, where they are placing a lot of focus on smart economy applications.

It was launched in late 2016, and was immediately dubbed the ‘Chinese Ethereum’. In September 2017, the Chinese government banned ICOs and there was a fear that NEO would not survive. However, it was proved the doubters wrong, and has very much grown, showing a huge growth in price throughout January.

VeChain (VEN):

VeChain is a little heard crypto project that is working hard to set itself apart from the crowd, and judging by the January figures, it is doing a very good job.

It has focused on the ICO and DApps market, placing an emphasis on powering the emergence of the IoT, and has since struck partnerships with a number of high profile Chinese firms.

Despite not seeing a huge amount of growth in the whole of 2017, this has definitely changed for the better this January.

3424,"I'm out guys. I can't afford to hold anymore. 

Financially sure but mainly mentally. Never seen losses like this before and even if everything skyrockets by x10 in a few months I won't regret leaving, cryptocurrency has been time consuming and given me a lot more stress. It was fun, an amazing valueless experience on investing, business, community, and what it truly means to support something. I'm glad I got into cryptocurrency 2 years ago. I'm glad I supported all the cryptocurrencies I did, even the ones I gained nothing from or had 0 stock in. It would of been nice if I didn't lose my recent x10 profits from last year down to only x2 and x3 profits in my holdings now. It would've been even nicer if I didn't make a few huge mistakes like taking out all my ADA and losing x50+ profits.

But man it was an amazing experience. I'm glad that I have more than my initial investment, everyone IRL who told me I would lose all my money was wrong. But if I'm being honest I'm still no where near wealthy and can use the tiny amount I have in crypto... I will always be depressed about how greedy I got hoping for 100x or 1000x to make millions lol, this is just one of many lessons learned from cryptocurrency. **Patience is key**. Ironically this goes against me buying out doesn't it? In all honesty I just actually believed in the cryptocurrencies I invested in and still do, I hope they succeed in the future and go on to be worth 100x what they are now, which I know they inevitably will someday. But seeing them go down to these prices... its just too heartbreaking since I seriously believe in the value of these cryptocurrencies.  Maybe a vast majority of cryptocurrency now will return to nothingness, but the ones I chose to invest in have all seemed to deliver everything so far and will one day fully achieve their vision. Well all except for BTC of course, it will inevitably be replaced by a x100000 superior currency like Ethereum so crashes like this can no longer happen.

I always imagined I'd be the one holding after years, the irony so many unexpected things happen in life.

Wait for when there's no moving body on the street. When there's noone with enough hope to buy just for lambos and moons, and everyone is dejected, will be the time to buy.

This is NOT the bottom. I do not trust that theres no collusion between wall street (theyre crashing too btw), korea and china, i do not trust the weak hands to hold my money and keep it safe and not sell. they will sell, their brows are filling up with sweat, their hands are shaky. HODL memes getting less funny by every 6b red candle, they've started shouting at everyone asking them about btc instead smiling and walking up to them for conversation. People who were hardcore believers in a decentralized world suddenly shat their pants when they saw their actual propped up, fake valued fiat go down. Idiots, how the fuck does it matter if you have 1 btc and it's for 17k or 9k? You still have 1 btc noone can take that until you give it away dumb fuck

only those who truly believe in future case, accepting that it may be a long time in the future, will be left standing after this. btc millionares weren't built by putting 1k on December 1st which turned into 10 million by January. These cleansings are a very important part of keeping the ecosystem free of idiots and truly growing to the scales we envision. Imagine if btc reaches 100k with a wall street pump and dump. Those old pieces of shit are just not far sighted enough to do it, but if these weak hands who don't understand the vision of crypto and hence have no confidence in their investment stay and continue getting rewarded, they're going to crash this shit on a way bigger scale when this replicates on a large scale.

3618,"Heres my take on this, this is good for the market. No, seriously.

Bitcoin is the king, but it is also the king shitcoin. It's slow and expensive and is only the king because of its history. It has no fucking business being the king anymore. It just so happens that the king also has A LOT of connections, to everyone. These connections are to the media and also to buying altcoins.

If you want to buy altcoins, you can buy BTC or ETH, and thats it. While ETH has been growing and wants to dethrone the king, its not quite there yet. Bitcoin has the support of the media because of its power as king. When the king is challenged, the media goes into a fucking frenzy and claims the bubble has popped. The peasants on the street run around in hysteria, some overjoyed the kings reign is ending, some scared of whats to come. Those that are scared are selling at all costs. Those that are happy are holding their alt coins, also scared because their altcoins are all tied to the king.

If the king goes down, its not going down without a fight, it has so many connections its taking everyone and everything with it. The sooner the king is removed from power the better it is for everyone.

Bitcoin, the king, is a shit coin. Purely in place because it was their first. While it has pioneered blockchain what does it honestly offer at this point. Besides being known to the masses it is slow and expensive and if released today in an ICO, wouldnt even be worth more than a few million market cap. For what it honestly offers, its shit. The fact it has connections and is first is what gives it importance, but for how long will that importance last?

I'm not even high, but for the entire market to move forward and grow (without proceeding to crash a month later) we need mass adoption. Mass adoption cannot come with Bitcoin.

The kings reign is slowly ending and we are all going down with it. We need to untie ourselves from Bitcoin.

What is their real competition? It looks like they have first mover advantage. I'm just thinking about the coins that support multisig and how they could be used anywhere on any marketplace, why is there a need for Payfair to exist?

People are allowed to take out CC/loan money for the following commodities in the US:

- 500k for college/professional school
- Hundreds of thousands to a million in houses
- A million or more in small businesses
- Personal credit line for U.S. casinos on slots, roulette, and table card games

^ All 4 assets which:

(1) are either extremely risky to the bank to dole out because they're putting financial trust in the client to pay it off (eg. small businesses where the majority fall under)
(2) have equally volatile value propositions over time (eg. 2000's housing crisis?)
(3) have low ROIs outright relative to what can be done to pay back that debt (eg. colleges with absurdly bad ROIs, degrees with essentially little marketplace return),
(4) are straight up stacked against the desk for the buyer from initial investment (eg. gambling, with the House always > 50% to win) to lose

Banks have no issues granting you those decisions above.  You're absolutely fooling yourself if you defend Too Big To Fail banks in the US allowing these assets to continue, but not one that could threaten their livelihood.  Banks rejoice when they put you on the hook for everything in society right now, except a new commodity that's a potential alternative to the mighty USD.

And then they freak out against a guy taking out $500 for alt coin crypto?

We tired to warn folks that these coins aren't worth thousands of dollars.

Their core function (money exchange) isn't happening at a useful rate in the marketplace. Who wants to spend a fraction of a Bitcoin then by the time the transaction has completed the value of the coin has changed drastically? Add in transfer fees and this was the outcome. 

All those buyers now realize the difficulty in actually using the damn coins. Whatda know? Super easy to buy but hard to cash out. Wonder who profits off that?

I was able to realize about 10% profits, reinvested that too, and then January dip/crash occurred and my portfolio is now down over 50% unfortunately. 

At this point I’m unsure if I should sell to buy back in something cheap in hopes that when it does go up some I could get very close back to my initial investment. I also am wondering if I should just continue to hold. For some examples, I have XRP from 1.90 and XLM from .70. I have a couple other coins too, no real shitcoins. maybe these can get back to those levels but I don’t know if or when people think they may or how long that would be?, but if I were to sell off now completely and reinvest it all at say, XLM at .35, then I could hope when it returns to .70 I double and essentially recoup my losses. Opposed rock holding and just getting back my XLM portion of my portfolio, while the rest my stay in red. 

Hopefully I’m making sense just confused at which way to go right now. I am completely tied up in 5-6 coins that have all dropped dramatically and I wonder if I need to risk a loss so I can be free from my positions to buy in lower in hopes of recovering quicker since I’ll then have a lower cost basis once/if market trends upwards",0.0761,daily_general_discussion_february_5_2018,0.082,0.845,0.072

4039,"For those that are losing confidence in their investment because of the recent bear market, but still believe in the technology, there are ways to make money without pulling out your initial investment. This isn’t an all or nothing game. This is investing in an emerging, highly volatile, possibly unhealthy, market.

Put some money in when you see massive amounts of red. There will be a bounce. Sell when there is a bit of an uptick in price. While the profits won’t be as immediate and substantial as the December moon/lambo kids would like, they can add up. We are in a bear market, and unfortunately, it probably won’t end soon. Rinse, lather, repeat, and you’ll see some short term profit. 

Rule of thumb is down swing trade with more than 2% of account capital. For example, if you deposit $1000, don’t risk more than $20 per trade.

I finally got approved on BitStamp, then used Coinbase to buy BTC and transfer to my BitStamp account, then purchased Ripple with BTC, but I would have been fine with someone doing it for me and sending it to my wallet.

The only method I found was a shady website somebody had thrown up and no way in hell was I going to give that nameless entity my money. I was wondering if operating as a registered business it would be possible to provide this service to people.

I'm not sure if it would be considered resale if I am taking the customers money up front before the purchase. So I'd technically be buying crypto with money that belongs to me, then giving it to the customer, rather than buying crypto, building a surplus, and selling it marked up.

I'll start: **6874 USDT**  (Don't downvote, put your imaginary money where your mouth is!)

I will give a months gold to the nearest guess, since Reddit Gold is still less than BTC for now. Maybe I should average the final results and see if the wisdom of crowds works for crypto.

4491,"Asian investors boost Swiss cryptocurrency wealth manager’s US$50 million digital fundraising
SwissBorg plans to build a computer dashboard, a cryptocurrency exchange, and a robo-adviser platform for investment in other cryptocurrencies
The fintech company SwissBorg’s initial coin offering received strong interest from Asian investors who bought nearly 30 per cent of the ICO to become members of the first blockchain-based wealth management community for cryptocurrencies, according to chief executive officer Cyrus Fazel. Last month, the Lausanne-based fintech firm raised 50 million Swiss francs (US$54 million) through the ICO – a fundraising mechanism whereby start-ups issue digital “tokens” or “coins” to fund a blockchain-related project.

Over 20,000 subscribers took part in the ICO, including Beijing-based Bitmain, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of processors for mining of bitcoin and Mauritius-based Warwyck Private Bank.

Traditionally, fund managers service high net worth individuals to help build their wealth. But by applying blockchain technology to explicitly link the company and the token holders, SwissBorg is aiming to build a “decentralised, autonomous organisation model” in the wealth management ecosystem where a lot more retail investors can benefit from a democratic, transparent and trustful investment services, Fazel said.

Blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology, is a big database that keeps a digital record of transactions which is openly accessible to all network users. It is also the underlying technology of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. http://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/2131923/asian-investors-boost-swiss-cryptocurrency-wealth-managers",0.9842,daily_general_discussion_february_4_2018,0.0,0.865,0.135

[BTC & ETH - the capitulation bottom is in](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7urbdu/btc_eth_the_capitulation_bottom_is_in/)



Human behavior is what's driving these markets. Fear and greed are fueling these moves. Humans are hitting the buy/sell buttons. There are rules of human behavior... the fear of loss is much stronger than the desire for gain. That's why selloffs happen much faster.

Institutional traders, hedge funds and a lot of big $$$ professional traders use rules. Trendlines, moving averages, support, resistance, pivot points and fib retracements are very popular tools.  

As a trader I look for areas and signs where the rules are being applied. There are times when a majority of traders ( or a few big $$$ funds) agree and they force the small investors to obey these rules 

All the big $$$ professional traders/hedge funds have rules based on TA...the individual trader who trades on news and emotions will be always get screwed by the big funds...unless they also learn the rules.

5063,"This is so much like watching the Internet bubble burst. I often monitored the Reddit equivalent of the day (yahoo stock message boards) back in 2000 and 2001.

If what I saw back then is any indicator, we have not seen bottom. In order for a true historically correct bottom, you need to see mass 'capitulation'.

I learned this term AFTER the Internet bubble burst, from talking heads on cable TV. They defined it technically, some shit like 'steeper than previous blah', plus other mumbo jumbo.

I kind of went back over the message boards after the bubble , relishing all the flames I got as I was short and screaming 'bubble' almost from ATH.

Here is what mass capitulation looked like on social media:

1) quantity of posts (doesn't matter short/long) drops off and stays off, and get's noticed by the remaining.

2) unless the poster is truly delusional (it's obvious) the delusional wishful thinking posts stop completely (all hope is lost?).

3) celebrity 'posters' (always long, today that's reddit,youtube,twitter, etc.) start to switch/defect, mea culpa's , I'm sorry's, etc.

Other observations:

There is something about 50% as a mental threshold. At the top of the Internet bubble, I could get some of my friends to accept that things were headed down after rises & splits equalling maybe 800%. For some reason everyone who agreed it was going down choose 50% as their expected drop? The aggregate drop for all my friends and all our ESOP shares was closer to 85-90%.

Another interesting observation. My circle of friends and associates working in the tech sector mostly worked at 5 big Silicone Valley tech firms. Of those 5, two no longer exist, three are owned by Oracle. The best recovery off of post burst ATL was 5 to 14, then Oracle bought for 19.

5214,"Made a post about this, but posting here so you guys stop trying to act cool:

I keep seeing a TON of posts how ""According to my analysis this dip isn't over and BTC will totally hit 5k"" or some variant of that. And of course these are countered by posts that say my analysis says the dip is over, time to buy, but negativity sticks much harder because we're all already depressed about this anyway.

My intention in pointing this out in that you guys' are literally spreading your own FUD. While we are just a small subset of Reddit, even myself, a fairly strong-handed HODLer starts to debate when I see enough ""This isn't over"" posts. If I go through daily and there's 5 people within an hour all saying according to their Analysis tomorrow will suck and I should sell now, I start to contemplate.

And here's my issue with people posting this, there is absolutely NO reason to other than you feeling cool that you were right. Even if your analysis is sound (pro-tip: it probably isn't), you're literally making a self-fulfilling prophecy. If your post convinces even one person to sell, you've hurt us all. Again, solely so you can feel like you were right. The worst are posts like ""I'm HODLing, but I think it's going to keep going down"". THEN WHY SAY THAT!? The youtube channels and things trying to gain views make sense, but you doing it for karma is just silly.

This is the most rumor-driven and skepticism-driven market in the world. Stop spreading your own FUD for zero reason and the dip might have an easier time.",-0.966,daily_general_discussion_february_2_2018,0.131,0.787,0.082
5215,"Something I want to remind people who are looking in horror at coinmarketcap with the value falling.  

Here's the thing.  We went up to $800 billion barely a month ago.  That means that there is *that much interest* and *that much volume* out there. 

Most of the people selling now are not gone forever.  They panic sell.  When the market rebounds, they FOMO back in. 

That's how the market cap can easily climb back to, and then past, it's ATH.  

Because you *know* the buyers exist.  It's just that many of them have weak hands.  

And institutional investors love this.  Many, in fact, probably purposefully instigate corrections and dips through sell off to accumulate more currencies at a discount.  They don't care about the day-to-day value; they've building 3 year and 5 year and 10 year predictions.  At the volume they trade, a 20% difference in a coin amounts to huge amounts of money.  

Cryptocurrencies are here to stay.  They will only get bigger, more ubiquitous, and more well adopted.  As they grow, we'll continue to see fluctuations.  Many bad projects will die or change or evolve. 

But the market will continue to grow.  These dips are where smart money buys in.  Money that doesn't care about 20xing in a month.  Money that's willing to buy in extremely cheap, and hold for years.  

There are people brigading this sub, and this thread, with baseless FUD and inflammatory panic-inducing screams.  These are probably buyers.  They like keeping the price low, because they odn't need the money, and want the cheap coins. 

Follow these extremely simple rules: 

* Buy low, and sell high (or, don't sell until you hit your target profits) 
* Don't put money in you can't afford to lose 
* Don't trade with emotion. 

It seems simplistic - but remembering this will really help you in the long run.

The entire US market is dumping right now in a huge correction across all markets.  Tech is dumping.  S&P500 is dumping.  Weed stocks are dumping.  
When the market goes down people consolidate their wealth into safe havens.  They pull money out of risky ventures, and triply out of speculative ventures like marijuana stocks (before legalization) and coins (which are nearly all speculative until real actual products hit the market).  
Keep in mind that the entire time bitcoin existed was nearly entirely a bull run for the stock market.  Crypto has never weathered a market wide bear market.  Now people are pulling money out to safer havens to reinvest later.  
The takeaway here is that if the us or world economy enters a beat market, the crypto market could be down for quite a while.  At least until we are no longer as speculative as we are now. ",0.7233,daily_general_discussion_february_2_2018,0.075,0.809,0.115

5288,"A few thoughts:

A lot of people and a ton of TA (I know, I know) shows the bottom to be found around 8k, by extension that means we'll probably never hit that target because people want to lock in buy orders just above the bottom. However people know this is what the traders are doing and so are putting in buy order even higher above ""the floor"".

The real bottom will be around *8.4k* - *8.6k* so we're almost there. 

Selling now is - in my opinion - **very** risky because we might bounce from the resistance at any time.

Stay safe out there, remember to have some perspective:

---

Where we are relative to MC:

* Total market cap as it was around the **10th of December**.

* Bitcoin as it was around the **25th of November**.

* Ethereum as it was around the **4th of January** but **higher** than it was the **17th of January**.

Long story short, it seems like there are a lot of people transferring their investments to hold cash at the moment, but it's not limited to just us. 


Now I'm not trying to say there isn't an ungodly amount of FUD against crypto in general right now, but to those thinking of selling at a loss, thinking of selling to secure a modicum of the profits you have made, or just thinking of getting out at all, think about what brought you into the crypto game and what kept you here for this long. Have the fundamentals on your coin changed? Have the partnerships changed? Has the tech devolved from a solid use project to straight vaporware? If the answer is no to those questions, there is absolutely no point in selling. On the flip side of that, when we see the market pumping, there shouldn't be a point in FOMO buying into the constantly occurring bull traps. We need to find a floor, which will mean tight sideways trading for an extended period of time, not just 6 hours or a day. 


It's okay to be worried about your investment, it's okay to be fearful, but if you got into this space for anything besides moons and lambos, holding through this period will pay off in due time.

Abrasive story cut/paste here:

I'm going to explain how market valuations work, how pricing works and is determined, and I'm going to do it by telling you a story about Billy, $7 bills and Autism. *My apologies for autism insensitivity.*

Billy is a fucking retard that grew up with no friends. Sure Chad and Fuckface  (unfortunate name) grew up on his street, but they never took Billy seriously, mostly because he was always eating glue.

These kids grew up and Chad married his high school sweetheart and became mayor of shitville. Fuckface, despite his shitty parents was a pretty smart kid and ended up getting 8 PHDs and a great job on Wall street.

One day, Billy got bored of tanking on his meat and went for a walk in the woods where he found a door under some leaves. He went inside and found a factory and a bunch of spooky skeletons. The factory made $7 bills, and there was 10 million of them.

Billy got pretty happy about this and went around trying to buy some fidget spinners in town but nobody would accept them as legal tender. Billy was sad. His bills were worth zero.

One day his toilet clogged because he tried flushing his $7 bills in frustration so he called Derek the plumber. Derek offered Billy $1 per bill, but only had $1000 to spend. Billy gladly accepted. Derek unclogged his toilet for him.

Billy didn't know it (he's fucking retarded after all) but his $7 bills marketcap was now $10M, even though only $1000 was spent. It had risen to this because Billy had found a buyer willing to pay $1 per bill, thus that is the value of his cache. 

Billy, being a retard, thought his bills were still useless but Derek kept coming over once a week offering to buy some bills for $1 each. Eventually word spread around town and he had many people knocking on his door, and he sold many more bills for $1 each.

Oddly enough, even though now $10000 had been spent, when he checked CMC he noticed that his bills marketcap was still only $10M. 

He thought this was strange so he decided he would stop giving away his $7 bills for $1. The total amount of money he made so far was $10000, or rather $9900 because he still owed Chad $100 for the $5 loan he took out back in 1982 to buy his green turtle pool that Billy still bathed in.

Or at least that's what he believed.  In fact his paper portfolio was very likely ""worth"" much MUCH more ($7 bills and all). However since Derek was the only seller, and since Billy was gladly accepting $1 each, and since Billy represented 100% of all sellers, his erroneous perceived value of $1 actually made the $7 bill worth $1 in reality, regardless of what number is printed on the face of it. You see, if I haven't mentioned this already, he's a fucking retard.

Now the citizens of Shitville, being not much smarter than Billy, decide that he must also be right about the value of this $7 bill (being worth only $1, because seriously, who makes a $7 bill anyways?). So the town has generally agreed that these $7 bills should be worth $1 each and stores even start accepting them as barter. 

As time goes by, Fuckface returns home from the big city. He hears about this new bill and investigates. It turns out these are the real deal, and even have official serial codes n shit. He still doesn't think anyone outside shitville is stupid enough to buy a $7 though. Nonetheless word spreads around town that Fuckface thinks these are real. People start offering $2 a bill, then 3, then $4, etc. 

You see this is how the value of an asset is determined. Something is only worth what the general consensus believes it is worth.

Time goes by and price has risen above $7 to $10. These have some cool art on the after all and they have become a status symbol. Sure it says $7 on it, but when Billy takes it to Fred the grocer, Fred let's him take home $10 worth of pornmags so who cares?

Chad gets wind of this and calls Fuckface up. Fuckface starts seeing people in the big city start carrying these $7 bills around as a fad. Fuckface and Chad are no dummies though, but they kind of want a part of the pie. It turns out these have value more than the $7 printed on them because they are rare as fuck and are collectables.

Chad and Fuckface, after being sad that they missed the boat, come up with an ingenious plan. 

The next day at the council meeting, Chad announces that the factory condition these were printed in was dangerous. Anyone holding the $7 bills were very likely to catch autism.

As news of this meeting (and that super smart and handsome Fuckface backing it), all autistics in shitville who are unable to think for themselves believe these bills cause autism. All of a sudden what was once a 100M market cap bill crashes to $20M, $2 per bill, literally instantly. 

It could have crashed to zero, but you see many people in town, being already fully autistic, are unafraid. Every single autistic person now controlled all these coins. Except for two others, you guessed it, Fuckface and Chad, who gobbled up as many as they could.

The market cap is now $20M.

A day later, one autistic sells a coin to another autistic (one single coin) for $1. The market cap is now $10M.

Now $10M did not exit the system. Only $1 did. 

You see, once the General consensus was that people should no longer trade a $10 bill for this new $7 bill, and even worse, it was perceived to only be worth $1 coin, the ""value"" immediately fell to that point. This happened the very second one of the autistics were able to get their hand on one single bill for $1. The seller determined he would meet the sale price, and since nobody else was willing to buy it for $2, the entirety of every single bill is now worth $1 each until people decide otherwise.

It remained at this value for a long time, as nobody was brave enough to get autism, not even Chad and Fuckface, because they just took a 50% hit and were afraid only autistics would buy their coin, and only for $1 now.

Billy, after starting with 10 million $7 bills no longer has any $7 bills. Despite being fully autistic, he was afraid to keep any $7 bills because of double autism reasons.

Regardless, Chad and Fuckface assess their situation and realize they are surrounded by idiots and that they are the only people that know that $7 are truly legit.

fuckface, who is greatly respected, makes a press announcement that he has conducted research, and his 53 PHDs conclude that the $7 is both totally legit and free of any autistic pathogens such as trace vaccinations.

Long term, the $7 bill returns to its full value, and even a bit higher due to its rarity. You see, Fuckface fell down the stairs carrying his bags and died on impact. His entire stash was auctioned off and people paid extra for this collectable, because he scribbled a minuscule dickbutt in the corner of every bill and signed, ""Bamboozled - Fuckface"".

TLDR - don't let Fuckface convince you that your $7 bill is worth $1, because the moment you do, that very second, IT IS.  Even if little to no money actually left the fucking system.

Edit: also, don't believe that a $7 bill is worth $10 unless there is a damn good reason for it, such as the rare and collectable immutable dickbutt signature.

Billy sold out his future in fear of double autism, and gave it all to Chad who has been giving Billy wedgies for 30 years, and just laid the coup-de-gras atomic wedgie of a lifetime on poor Billy.",-0.9947,daily_general_discussion_february_2_2018,0.132,0.752,0.117

This ""bubble"" was 1/8th of the Dotcom Bubble, which began with institutional money, followed by retail money.

This is the opposite. We've started with retail, we created our ""bubble"". Smart money popped it because they knew were a bunch of Tide Pod eating morons that believe in the news we read and will freak out at the slightest sign of ourr $1,000- $10,000 investments going down 20%. You're freaking out about the money you put in? Then you put it too much too early. Keep some one the sideline until this is ""legitimized"" 

Institutional money is picking up all the leftovers, they know the good projects. You can guarantee they have been researching what to invest into, and now they get it on discount.

5814,"Crypto’s ‘Positive Story Remains Intact’: Wall Street Strategist Undeterred by Bitcoin Price Decline
It’s been a dismal year so far for the cryptocurrency markets, and — as evidenced by the Bitcoin price’s more than 50 percent retrace from its all-time high — the volatility has begun to shake out investors with weak hands.

Bitcoin bears have begun to take their victory laps, with skeptics forecasting that its plunge to zero is now inevitable.

Wall Street Strategist Tom Lee, however, refuses to waver from his optimistic outlook — or his bullish Bitcoin price forecast.

Lee, a former JPMorgan equity strategist who now runs market research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, told clients that now is an excellent opportunity to consider adding to their cryptoasset stakes.

“It has been a terrible few weeks but the fundamental positive story for crypto remains intact,” CNBC cites him as saying in the report, distributed late Thursday night just hours after the Bitcoin price declined below $8,000 for the first time since November.

He told clients not to panic, reminding them that throughout Bitcoin’s history, sell-offs have been generally been followed by significant rallies within a relatively short period of time. Based on this data, he said that it is worth the risk for investors to add to their positions, even if the market continues to decline.

“Past sell-offs were followed by rallies of ~150% within 84 days,” Lee said. “In other words, we think the risk/reward at these levels warrants adding here, even if there is additional downside.”

Lee reiterated that, according to Fundstrat’s valuation model, the Bitcoin price should reach $20,000 by mid-year and ultimately attain the historic $25,000 milestone before the market rings in the new year. He added that the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC) — which recently executed a 91-for-1 stock split — should trade at $30 during that same timeframe.

Other large-cap coins, meanwhile, have a similarly-bullish future. He forecast that Ethereum, which is currently trading at $943, should more than double to $1,900 by the end of the year, while NEO and Ethereum Classic could reach $250 and $60, respectively.

5815,"From the ashes of the dot.com crash Amazon and Google were the two notable names that survived and grew. 

It’s inevitable that sooner or later crypto will burst, maybe this is it maybe this isn’t, when that burst happens the weak coins will get flushed down the drain and only the strong will remain. 

Yes “easy money” days will be over, but on the flip side the scammers and shitcoins will get forced out. Coins won’t be able to prosper on “road maps “ alone and never even bother starting the journey  , they will have to deliver what they promise. 

Only the strong will survive, evolution , maybe even a revolution in the blockchain, because when you think about it from the users point of view shits pretty primitive on a UI/UX level. Someone sends their coins to the wrong wallet and it could be lost forever, you get hacked and your coins are gone forever, sorting out these issues are the next step and the coin/contract  that finds a solution to these problems,  while still maintaining privacy and staying decentralised, will come out on top.",-0.5784,daily_general_discussion_february_2_2018,0.131,0.746,0.123

Back then VERGE was only worth 540 BTC. So if you had $250 to gamble on numerous coins and you decided on VERGE at #104 as one of them and held till a month ago then you turned $250 into $5,000,000 basically 1 BTC into 300 BTC in 26 months. That was probably the best trade in the last 26 months.

5848,"To the people who are seriously think of investing more tonight, obviously this is just my opinion but I think it’s best to wait. Think of the two ‘bad’ scenarios that can come from it.

1. You buy tonight, then it dips even lower in upcoming days.

2. You don’t buy tonight and stuff starts rebounding majorly so you end up missing the absolute lowest point to buy. This is a GOOD thing. This means the market is finally heading back in the right direction to your original investment and potentially more. Who cares if you didn’t buy the lowest point.

Instead I think it’s good to wait for the bottom. Yes I know no one can predict the lowest point but it’s not like you actually have to catch it on the absolute bottom. Once it hits that final low point it will linger around there for some time, it’s not going to skyrocket in an hour and have the market cap go from 200 billion to 600 billion or something like that. If weeks go by and you notice there’s a solid upward trend finally happening from hitting a low, that would be a good time to buy in IMO. Yeah it won’t be the absolute lowest but still probably a better option than buying every one of these dips every few days just to have it dip even lower a few days later.",0.73,daily_general_discussion_february_2_2018,0.132,0.732,0.136

1. What coin is profitable rn to mine with my setup? (whattomine.com is confusing, IDK what I'm supposed to look at, and as far as I have seen there is no button for calculating profits made by mining with my card) Also, which program would you recommend? (I'd preffer software that does not mine on 100% of my graphic card's power, more on that in the next question.

Hope you are holding up well - difficult times.
As for my background: I work in Investment banking (Sales & trading) so I like to think I know a thing or two about markets, bubbles and trading mechanisms.
I have been a long time lurker in this sub und have been following Crypto very closely for many years but hardly ever invested. One thing that bothers me in this thread is the analogies made with the stock market or bond market or whatsoever - you can't do that... 
Stocks are audited balance sheets + an estimated growth value divided by the number of stocks. Bonds are debt contracts with underlying hard covenants protecting investors. (disclaimer: oversimplification - happy to elaborate)

Cryptos have no covenants, no audits, no obtainable balance sheets. be careful when saying things like (actual quotes I read here today):

""the stock market crashed several times and it always recovered. good time to enter cheap""
""
""Every market in the history market has recovered after crashing""
""Crypto reached 800 Billion and it will reach that again and then surpass that""

As for: ""institutional money did this""
I doubt it. Institutional money is strictly always managed with strict rules. Large Asset Managers (Think Black Rock, Allianz GI, Invesco, Och-Ziff) receive strict rules from the pensions and insurances that give them the money and trust me, Crypto is not an option for them. You might have a few hundred million managed by sketchy HFs investing into crypto but that is outnumbered by retail (all of us).

Markets are risky and life is uncertain. Most of us will have financial good fortune at some point in our lives, and some setbacks too. The best we can do, then, is save when times are good so we can survive when times are bad.

The thing is, most Americans appear to follow the opposite advice, spending in good times and saving in bad. In December, the US personal saving rate fell to 2.4% of disposable income, the lowest level since 2007, which itself was low by historical standards.

My contention is that the Big Money realized crypto is a thing in early December. They colluded to drive down prices so they can essentially turn back the clock 4 months to get in on low prices. For December / early Jan average-Joe buyers this means you were unlucky and you have virtually zero first mover advantage into the game while assuming most of the risk. The good news is the price will go back up, manipulators won't let crypto die, it is too easy to manipulate. You just have to wait it out and assume you had all of your dead money locked in a checking account with zero interest for another few months to a year. That sucks, but it isn't the worst thing in the world. The people who lost the most were those who panic sold at ATL.

On December 30th, he [called $8000 as a short-term target](http://greyenlightenment.com/bearish-bitcoin-chart-formation/). He recommended [buying altcoins at the beginning of January](http://greyenlightenment.com/consider-altcoins/), which still worked out if you sold at the right time :p

His currently analysis:

> In the short term, it’s going to get worse. All these people who bought in late 2017 have to throw in the towel. There are folks who amassed small fortunes, and by late 2017 thought they had achieved the dream financial freedom only to watch it evaporate in span of just five weeks. In the end, it’s just money anyway, and you cannot take it with you after you die. **Given that Bitcoin is already down 60% from its December highs and Bitcoin’s 9-year history of recovering from selloffs, at this point it probably makes sense to hold. Just mentally prepare yourself for the possibility that it will lose another 50%.**

6350,"Bitcoin price drops below $8,000 for first time since Nov. 24

Bitcoin's value has dipped below $8,000 for the first time in 11 weeks in the midst of a broader cryptocurrency sell-off.

The volatile digital asset fell as low as $7,923 on Friday at 6:48 a.m. ET, according to Coinbase data. It dropped below the $8,000 level for the first time since November 24, according to CoinDesk, which tracks prices from digital currency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Bitfinex.

Multiple virtual currencies have dropped significantly as regulators voiced concerns about them and worries grew over suggestions that the price of bitcoin has been propped up by popular exchange Bitfinex.

On Wednesday, Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley warned against criminal activity associated with cryptocurrencies, and said that India would ""eliminate"" the use of cryptocurrencies in ""illegitimate activities.""

That same day, The New York Times reported that an increasing number of cryptocurrency investors were concerned about the price of bitcoin other virtual assets being propped up by Bitfinex, one of the exchanges included in CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

Both Bitfinex and Tether, the digital currency backed by the former's executives, have been surrounded in controversy following the reports. Tether — which is pegged to the U.S. dollar — was down almost 1.9 percent on Friday.

The cryptocurrency market has halved in less than a month

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all other major cryptocurrencies are taking a pummeling today. BTC is at $8,234, down 16.3 percent in the last 24 hours, and Ethereum is at $858, down a whopping 23 percent in the same time period, according to CoinMarketCap. 

Overall, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined is currently $389 billion, roughly 53 percent down from its Jan. 7 high of $835 billion. 

SEE ALSO: Bye-bye, Bitcoin. It's all about bananacoins.

The correction is likely due to the onslaught of bad news regarding cryptocurrencies in the last couple of months. China has banned cryptocurrency trading in September. South Korea implemented stricter cryptocurrency trading rules this week. India's finance minister said Thursday the country's government will take measures against cryptocurrencies being used as payments. 

There's also mounting doubt whether Tether, a cryptocoin that's pegged to the price of U.S. dollar and allegedly backed in U.S. dollars at a 1:1 ratio, is in fact a scam. Potentially scammy Bitconnect was shut down in January. Weeks ago, hackers made away with more than $420 million worth of cryptocurrency, stolen from Japanese exchange Coincheck. And a lot of prominent investors, from Warren Buffett to Peter Boockvar, recently expressed skepticism towards cryptocurrencies. 

Add to that the fact that cryptocurrencies typically fare bad in January, and that the Chinese might be selling their coins ahead of the Chinese new year, and you've got a perfect storm of news that can cause even the most resilient cryptocurrency to plummet.

The light at the end of the tunnel could be the immense amount of money and brains that has poured into crypto in recent years, and the fact that Bitcoin has always bounced back from previous corrections. Right now, though, everyone seems to be too busy hitting the ""sell"" button to think about that. 

Disclosure: The author of this text owns, or has recently owned, a number of cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH.

I'm new to investing and cryptos. Work in legal so I'm not exactly completely daft about markets, but I'm still by all means a dumbass.

I invested about 2 weeks ago, 1000 euros. The portfolio grew to 1300, everything was green, ETH boomed, at this point I sold and ETH was +1000.

It started dipping then so I bought, only for it to keep dipping, so I sold at 1230. This was when ETH dipped to 880.

Now its close to 600 and keeps dipping. I'll buy when it reaches the bottom and then it hopefully goes back up some 20% at which point I sell and withdraw only to have made some 500ish euro profit.

It's used currently by massive Fortune 500 companies as a way to guarantee uptime.

6789,"This is not a sub that I often follow, but as far as I see bearish sentiment is predictably frowned upon. Guys, you should never make your decisions according to what random Internet strangers say, but if you have a position in alts, I'd at least ask you to consider selling. It's not late, we're still in very early stages of bubble popping. Those who have not been through the bear market starting from July 2017 need to go to Coinmarketcap now and take a look. Those who held through it (like me) should not repeat the same mistake. Not only this time is not different, but given the novelties in BTC like LN and RSK which may make many alts obsolete, this time it's actually worse for alt holders.

I know that I sound like a BTC maximalist, but honestly I'm not. I'm not a maximalist of anything, I have no ideological positions for any cryptocurrency. I'm in this strictly to make money. Holding is fine, I held LSK from $0.20 to $17 (and sold early, damn). But it's even better to sell near top and repurchase your favorite alt at a discount. 

To repeat, I'd advise everybody not to swim against the current. There will be odd altcoins that will outperform BTC during this cycle, but chances are slim that those will be the ones with the biggest share in your portfolio. Statistically you'll bleed value in BTC, and maybe even more in fiat. So don't listen to my advice, but also don't listen to the eco-chamber.

7152,"Ut OH!!! JPMorgan, Bank of America Say No to Crypto Transactions on Credit Cards
The top two US banks took what little wind was left in investors’ sails today. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have both placed a ban on cryptocurrency transactions via credit cards, according to Bloomberg reports. The bitcoin price is holding at about a 5.75% decline, trading at $8,589 in what is shaping up to be a rocky 2018 for cryptocurrency trading so far.



JPMorgan, whose CEO Jamie Dimon famously denounced bitcoin a few months back, doesn’t want to inherit the credit risk given the volatility in the bitcoin price. By speculating on the price of a highly volatile investment like bitcoin, investors are exposing the bank to a higher risk of default, a scenario that may not have been present when the credit was extended in the first place. Meanwhile, banks and regulators are working in tandem to detect signs of fraud, and taking credit cards out of the equation simplifies things somewhat.

JPMorgan’s ban goes into effect on Saturday, Feb. 3, while Bank of America’s ban became effective immediately, with the bank declining credit card transactions with crypto exchanges, as per internal memos obtained by Bloomberg. While personal and business B-of-A credit cards are included in the ban, the bank will continue to honor all debit card transactions with cards issued by the bank.

The move no doubt has investors scrambling, some of whom have automatic buy orders in place at exchanges. And it places an immediate hurdle in bitcoin’s move toward the mainstream, as potential investors who may have been weighing the field now have another hoop to jump through to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies.

But by the same token, if what’s going to move bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies forward is investors “not investing more than they can afford,” than the bank ban becomes less of a hurdle and more of an inconvenience.

Meanwhile, Chase and B-of-A aren’t the first banks to move on bitcoin. Discover and Capital One already ruled out cryptocurrency charges, while Citi appears to be on the fence.

But for Discover’s chief executive David Nelms, there may be some wiggle room. Discover has banned cryptocurrency transactions because the only use cases Nelms is witnessing today are for ransomware and money laundering. But he stopped short of writing bitcoin off, telling Bloomberg that what could inspire a shift is customer demand.

So perhaps in this early stage of loose regulation governing the cryptocurrency space, it’s prudent for banks to take a step back so the industry can move forward.

In the words of Wences Casares, chief executive of Xapo –

7296,"There are several factors at play for the dip the media influence (cnn, msnbc, Crypto space guys like Ver etc), regulations coming from large countries who do sizable amounts of trading, and the recent scams. These are all playing a major factors and most people I feel are naive about the crypto market and that it’s not being manipulated. With all of the negatives out there it's driving prices down. People manipulating the market are a huge underlying problem that I don't really see a lot of people discussing. I mean I get it is the wild west out here and if you get caught with a few bags it's see you fucking later. 

So beware. Obviously. 

But on a positive note for the longevity and larger exposure for crypto as a whole more companies especially at the local level are adopting payments for bch ltc eth -etc. Which is great. Also Robinhood is going to launch thier crypto side in February. 1M waiting list as of yesterday. Fee-less trading.... I think we all know how huge that is. As well as some larger exchanges in India and others adding more coins. 

So take advantage of the dip and when these scams hit and exchanges shut down. I believe Things will settle and add a new floor within 3-4 weeks. 

Also with Robinhood is going to bring much needed competition to drive these exchanges to compete and closer margins otherwise they'll lose everyone. I think that's what we saw with gdax and coinbase being off by a hundred or two difference in trading compared to other exchanges this past weekend. Trying to keep everyone buying there and hold onto the customers as long as possible til Robinhood shows up. 

Either way I expect a significant jump mid February.

I bought a house in 2006. I sold my house in 2009 (the down-leg of the property bubble bursting). 

I will not sell my crypto, regardless of price action (I have paper losses now).

Every generation thinks 'this time is different'. Every generation has been wrong (so far). But in no other asset class that I am aware of has there been the HODL mentality that we have in crypto. This is important. There is a stubborn and bloody-minded 'fuck you' attitude in crypto that has created a community that holds through storm(s).

This psychology comes from different places. Partly it is anti-establishment. Partly it comes from a knowledge of how systemically corrupt the legacy financial system is, and that it is designed to exclude the vast majority of us from wealth-creation opportunities. Partly it is the love of the tech. Partly it is a confidence that blockchain will fundamentally change the world. All of these components link to create a resilience that can shield crypto from the type of short-termism that has worsened and lengthened previous asset-class collapses.

Again - this is important. It feels like we have the opportunity to break the shackles that previous generations have been held down by. And simply by holding our assets we can frustrate the agendas of those who want to see us in debt, trapped in 9-5 careers, bereft of options. We must not forget this.

7556,"Anyone else have a semilarge position in a random low marketcap coin that you feel bullish about for absolutely no sensible reason at all - like having a random feeling it will hit a certain number despite every piece of logic pointing towards the opposite?

For me personally that coin is Mintcoin. It appears to be a legitimate, but low-budget hobby project of volunteers. Apparantly a bunch of people in California spending their spare time on making the 'eco-friendly' coin sort of. Their website and whitepaper is seriously lacking, and there is absolutely no logical reason or evidence that this will be a massive gainer anytime this decade, and they even say so themselves. (Open and upfront at least huh?)

BUT, my GF's name is Mint and her lucky number is 22. So I've taken a ~5% position of my portfolio in it with an exit target at 22 cents, which would require the coin to do like a 240x from where it's currently sitting at 8 satoshis, and take it to over a $4 billion marketcap which would make absolutely no sense for a project like this. (Though I guess doge/pac/dcn have shown us stranger things may happen)

There is apparantly a whitepaper and reworked website coming somewhere down the road but there's no dates and not a very active social media profile for it - but maybe it can go up a little bit - I'll have to hodl regardless though because I promised her on the odd chance it hits my crazy target I'm buying her a Chanel purse of her choice and a Tesla Model 3 haha.

Just wanted to share my nonsense pick here since the market is dead and everyone is just freaking out over XRB today anyways - did anyone else do something like this and take a position in a crazy coin? Or have you perhaps also invested in Mintcoin?

Please share with me your nonsense picks, and the story behind why you picked them :P 

PS: I also put $20 in each of Slothcoin and Penguincoin for the luls - I know they're scams, and can't even be traded rn because Cryptopias LTC market is gone but it just somehow amuses me to be a 'millionaire' in Sloths and Penguins, two of my favourite animals.",-0.8514,daily_general_discussion_january_30_2018,0.12,0.77,0.11

8440,"n00b w/ a couple simple questions.  Let me know if I should post this somewhere else.  My main question concerns the paper wallets.  I'm looking to buy some coins to hodl, as in me hodl long time.  I'm not interested in trading really at all.  I understand that most currencies have wallets with the two keys, if I am able to keep the private key private, can I continue to put coin into that wallet without ever really needing to worry about checking it?  I don't mean that I would never check the balance or anything, I just mean if I have, say, one wallet for btc, one for eth, can I just keep those wallets for years or should I create new wallets occasionally?  And regarding security,  I have seen many posts describing the different levels of security -- but if I just use an offline wallet generator and print the private key with a corded printer will I be 99.9% safe (I have a mac, and I'm not the kind of person to click random links in emails)?  Finally,  there are a bajillion coins/currencies, I've narrowed it down to about 10 I would like to hold (presently).  What is the best way to buy the different coins?  I am currently on Coinbase and Binance, pending Bitstamp, but even if I have access to each of those it seems I still use another 5 or so exchanges to buy the other coins I want.  Is there an easier way to do this?  Is an app like Exodus useful/safe for exchanging?  Thanks in advance for any advice, like I said, if I'm in the wrong place let me know.",0.974,daily_general_discussion_january_30_2018,0.04,0.84,0.12

Bitcoin.tax allows you to connect it to your various exchanges to upload your transaction history. You can also add in individual trades and other information manually. I think some things can't quite fit in - crypto kitties or whatever? - but it's pretty good overall. It'll analyze the data and show you your spending, selling, and realized gains. You can download reports like the .TXF file for TurboTax, so that you can simply upload the completed 8949 .txf rather than having to input all crypto sales and purchases. 

While it's free to upload/input your information into Bitcoin.tax if you have under 100 transactions, you'll have to pay to download the completed forms, including the .txf file for TurboTax. However, **you can only upload this file on the desktop version of TurboTax. There is no upload option for TurboTax online.** I used TT Home & Business, which I bought from a local Target on sale. 

If you are using the desktop version, you can upload it by going to File in the upper left [and then the following steps](https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1899278-how-do-i-import-from-the-txf-file). I specify ""upper left"" because the final step in the filing process is File, and I was really confused because I forgot about the *other* File.

8647,"I’d like to have an honest discussion of what that future of crypto is, and how we can make that come sooner than later.

1.) PROBLEM: Businesses adopting the currency: This is obviously the hardest goal to achieve, and simultaneously will spark the market cap. Right now this area of crypto is so starved that even the most minor of business associations can cause a 100% gain. This is problem #1. If it doesn’t make sense to businesses they won’t use it. This is definitely not given enough attention by the community. No business wants swings on its bottom line due to currency fluctuations, and no business wants to actually think about implementing something difficult if it doesn’t have immediate gains. Yes we are in the nascent stage of product development, but right now from the outside it looks like a money grab to the creator of the coins.

POSSIBLE SOLUTION: A coinbase like exchange that can instantly withdraw US dollars for what the currency is trading for at that time. This would require an exchange that is backed by huge US dollars, but how else will adoption work? This exchange or it’s applications will need to integrate with that businesses regular work-flow to make taxes, accounting, etc. easy.
Businesses would gain in multiple ways from easier accounting, to elimination of price fluctuations. Crypto needs to work with fiat, at least for now, not against it. If something isn’t done, we are going to see a Visa blockchain a lot faster than anyone would like.

2.) PROBLEM: Getting businesses thinking about the currency: Crypto is trendy, but your average non-gaming business and save for a few potpourri like Overstock.com, are not thinking about Crypto. This is the same problem that the Internet had when it began as well and everybody was confused by it being something techy and nerdy and not something for practical use.

POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Crypto needs what it most likely hates: salespeople. It really is that simple. Save for a few CEO’s who may or may not believe in blockchain, salespeople are the only ones who can put this technology into stores and make it make sense. Google uses salespeople, Apple, etc. The business side of Crypto is now the end lacking development.

OMG: AMA on the 31st. Recent video with Vitalik. Something big is coming. This coin is also on major dip. It will have a good week (and a good year for that matter)

AMB: I may have helped contribute to this, but AMB is looking like Reddit's next coin now that the VEN hype has somewhat died. Possible partnership announcements via lifted NDAs on the 31st.

AION: At ICX summit on 31st. Much more upside the ICX. Riskier, but the potential profit is worth the risk.

DNA: Genomics conference tomorrow should be HUGE considering they just proved their product actually works.

HST: Major exchange coming soon (likely Binance). Hardly anyone is selling this on Kucoin right now because we're all HODLing, but try to get in as cheap as possible.

XBY: Testnet results tomorrow/Tuesday. Next testnet is waiting on patents but Discord is saying it should be fairly soon. This coin has an absolutely insane amount of upside and it's dipped hard.

Yea well we also just read that Tether broke ties with their auditor because of different opinions. Okay for me this is a BIG red flag. You only break up with an independent auditor if they have something to say which you dont like, and which you dont want the general public to know about.

So when, not if but when, Tether implodes we could see the fall of BTC as well. We all know that someday Ethereum will become the number one ranking crypto, its only a matter of time. So would it be better to move the BTC investments into ETH, or do you guys have another opinion?

ETHbits. I saw some interesting and some less interesting stuff in this thread. However nothing comes close to ETBS. Can be purchased on ED for ~5$. It will be an exchange token just as BNB or KCS. The exchange is planned to go live at end Q2. The point is ETBS was sold in ICO at 0.1ETH, to guarantee a 10x for the ICO-people as ETBS and ETH will be equally valued in the new exchange. Sounds too good to be true? It sure does, but I haven't found anything that states different than that. Bigger rumours will come soon, marketing will start more as we get closer to the exchange opening.
I don't say it works but if it works it's probably the best investment you can do in the crypto-space atm.

I'm starting to get a better grip on understanding / predicting rises in ETH / BTC kings and their effects on alt pricings - wondering if anyone can relate to what I'm explaining and perhaps offer some advice or tune me into their strategy

Even a sentence or two with your view / procedures, etc. would be helpful

[BTC 4hr chart - weekly pivots](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HkzQdb2n/)

[BTC daily chart - monthly pivots](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gUpNY7Vc/)

John Carter made an observation in his book Mastering the Trade of a reoccurring pattern when pivots/support/resistance are tested that it is common for the 4th attempt to succeed which is what happened yesterday. There has been no follow through or enthusiasm on part of investors to celebrate this epic achievement though - lol. We now have an uptrend on the 4h chart to keep an eye on. 

BTC is consolidating just above the WP (weekly pivot) @ 11,700. It's been 3  weeks since BTC closed above the weekly pivot however we are very close to breaking that pattern. The good news is that when the next daily candle starts forming (Monday) it will more than likely be above next weeks pivot. Pivots change from week to week based on the previous weeks price movements. 

All in all this week has been overall positive for BTC. The Stoch RSI has crossed up above 20 and we broke through the 1st downtrend. There is plenty of resistance above so it will not be easy. It's been slow going so far and I don't see anything to change that.",0.9547,daily_general_discussion_january_28_2018,0.034,0.852,0.114

* Binance total trading volume last 24H = 2291m

KCS do offer some dividends which BNB do not, but is that really enough to make up for this huge disparity in relative value?

So do you think BNB is undervalued, KCS is overvalued or the dividends and expected utility of KCS make it deserving of its current valuation.

> Bonds provide a source of funds to purchase potentially higher-yielding investments when they can be had at discount prices during market downturns, reduce your portfolio's volatility, and usually offer a steady return themselves. On the technical side, there are numerous studies that show that 100% (or more) stock investors are not compensated in proportion to the extra risk they take on by doing so. While stocks have outperformed bonds over the long run to date, ""past performance is not indicative of future returns."" **Finally, the psychological/emotional effects of a severe bear market really cannot be appreciated until they're felt first hand. It is one thing to say you're OK watching half of your investment portfolio evaporate in a few weeks. It's quite another to watch it happen for real and have the wherewithal to stay the course.** Bonds offer some consolation in such a scenario.

Not sure where to go from here.. I'm still in the green but it's obviously not where I was a couple weeks ago. I don't know if I should keep holding my coins that aren't doing much at the moment (dbc, bnty) for something that has more potential and is already top 25 like omg for instance (seems pretty good entry at $16).. 

I like dbc and bnty and think they have potential and that they will definitely have another bullish run *soon*, but for the past 5-10 days it's just been going down and down.. I just know if I sell they will double in a matter of hours.

My goal is for my portfolio to increase by 6x.  The only changes I would like to make are to increase my holdings in ETH, and XRB.  If/when I see some better gains on some of these alts, I might exchange them for ETH/XRB, but, for now, this is my portfolio.  Any tips/critiques?

If it wasn't for the posts about OriginTrail over the past few days, I would have never known about it, researched into it, and invested. Yes I know OriginTrail has been shilled to death lately, but I don't care. Sometimes projects are shilled on here and they are at best mediocre. This was one of those rare times that a project was shilled and it was actually a legit great project in a very competitive, utility driven, and lucrative space in crypto (i.e., supply chains). I missed out big time on VEN and WTC. I know a lot of folks did too. My portfolio lacked projects like those, and this sub clued me in on a great one that's still undervalued. Not everything is a winner when it's shilled here, but this sub has been a major contributor to my overall research, or at least the start of it for each coin I've seen posted here. So far OriginTrail has made me a very happy camper, and I wanted to extend a big thank you to this community. Keep up the awesome work, even if it's at times just constant flavor of the month promotions/advertising.

9983,It’s scary how quick you get spoiled in this market. I invested in early December last year. Maybe two weeks before the big wave. I picked 8 projects I believe in after doing research for days. On December 19th I was already up 160%. Never felt real. 2 days before Christmas the market „crashed“ (for a newbie like me it felt like a crash) and I went down to 20% profit over night. That day I bought I made my last purchase. NEO. Bought in at 50. Felt good. Between Christmas and New Years my portfolio exploded. I was up 400% (bought XRB at $1 and REQ at .16). Shortly after that everything went down and stayed that way for the last few days/weeks. I dropped back down to 100% profit and felt frustrated. What. The. Fuck. 100% profit during a major dip. Only 2 months after my initial investment. That’s insane. But somehow I got soiled so quickly that I couldn’t enjoy it anymore. All of a sudden everything under 250% was’n even worth checking details.

10008,"There are a few things I've noticed here lately that people need to realize.

First, People should be rooting for coins that are competing in the same space. Competition is good, it drives growth and innovation. Secondly, you should invest in both coins as a hedge for the other coin.

The most prominent one in this subreddit is WTC vs. VEN. You should be rooting for one another, and you shouldn't go all-in on one of these coins as they both have their positives and negatives.

You know when people say diversify their portfolio? That should also include diversifying with in certain classes/industries (Financial systems, Supply chain, Protocols, DEX).

If you invested in both VEN and WTC you would be having an awesome month without having to hate on the other one.

If you believe in one more than the other, then put a larger percentage of your portfolio in that one (i.e. 70/30 VEN or 70/30 WTC)

Second thing:

I've been noticing an increase in the number of comments here recently asking whether or not to sell a coin. When I see that I immediately think that either:

A. the person was shilled the coin and didn't do their research

or

B. FOMO'd into it and didn't do their research.

Notice something in common? DYOR.

People tell you to do your own research because it gives you so much more confidence in what you're investing into and allows you to weather the storm. 

[It's in human psychology to perceive a loss as more detrimental than a gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion). 

I find that the loss is amplified tenfold when you have no fucking clue what the coin is supposed to do. If you do your due diligence the losses hurt less and the gains are more satisfying.

So I only witnessed the extreme climb and the dip. Then I saw all these graphs showing the ""usual"" January dip which always happened over the last years and i wondered, since I see so much of: ""Just wait for the bounce back"" and ""Just wait a few weeks then we go back to new ath's"" comments.

Was there also so much positivity and faith back then? Or rather; what was the generel mood in such times ""back then""?

10285,"Since it is a very slow day, I will add something that I've noticed about advices on this forum.  

In general, everyone wants to make money from crypto.  But each of us have a different goal when it comes to how much money we want to make.  Some of us want to minimize risk and make much as possible whereas others do not mind the risk and want to make as much as possible.  In other words, some would be ecstatic if their porfolio grew to 1.5x by the end of 2018, whereas some would want at least 100x on their return by end of 2018 while conceding that they are willing to take high risks. 

So it seems like given that there is a diverse selection of group, one set of advice (e.g. diversify your portfolio) should not be held as some sort of an axiom.  I think this especially applies for someone like me.  I have put in around 5% of my savings so if I lose everything, it won't make much difference in my life at all.  So I would want to go for the high risk high reward strategy since I don't care about losing everything.  As such, a riskier portfolio/strategy is what I prefer.

9,"Have been seeing a lot of questions about where to find out about new, promising coins/projects. This is directed to all new users who'd like to become early investors:

Check Bitcointalk's altcoin announcement section daily (bitcointalk.org - forum founded by Satoshi for bitcoin/crypto discussions). This is where cryptocurrency devs/teams/founders/CEOs announce and pitch their project *before* exchange releases.

Buying low cap coins, or buying any and every new coin released on an exchange, and waiting for a large pump is just gambling. 

Actively looking for new project announcements can allow for you to find promising coins BEFORE they hit the market. Read new announcements white papers, analyze the team and focus, and read what some of the veterans have to say about it. If you find a promising coin/project before it hits any exchange, and you buy it up right when it is released on an exchange, then you can make some serious long-term profits; if your country allows it, this is a great way to find promising ICO's and presales - great way to buy cheap coins in bulk before it even hits an exchange.

This is the best way to become an early investor in promising coins - don't just gamble, invest with confidence. I cannot emphasize this enough.",0.9876,daily_general_discussion_january_7_2018,0.015,0.816,0.169

37,"I was a bit bearish earlier this week, but now I am completely bullish.  I think next week, we will have so many new customers who have heard the story of getting rich (2x, 3x) in one week.  And this thing will shoot up to 1 trillion marketcap in about 7-10 days.  So honestly, I think next week can be the greatest investing opportunity of everyone's life time. 

So I guess my question is this.  If we just take a look at short term (7-10 days), what is the optimal method here?  Personally, I think the cheap price coins that jumped last week are going to jump again with people telling stories.  So in that case, should we just divide up the money (7-10) into these coins, etc., time the jump out, and move the funds to a different cheaper priced coins?  

I REALLY feel like if we can collectively decide on the best method, that method will win out and everyone will get rich once this thing shoots trillion.  Thoughts?   ",0.9928,daily_general_discussion_january_7_2018,0.016,0.764,0.22

119,"I saw SNOV mentioned in here yesterday and I wanted to give my thought on the project. So this project looks like it‚Äôs aiming to be a form of decentralized salesforce. Ultimately this looks less like a dapp and more like a project that is using cryptocurrency as a method to incentivize building a database that others will then use the currency to purchase from the database. I did buy a small portion when it hit kucoin because it does look poised to grow, but it is probably not a long term hodl for me as I don‚Äôt see myself ever using the product. 

**What does it do?**
Decentralized marketing lead generation platform. The project is looking to build a decentralized database of leads. The platform would consist of contributors who adds leads to the platform and customer who retrieve data from the platform. 

**How is the token used?**
The token is used as payment for the leads and the person who added or generated the lead will receive tokens. Example used in the white paper ‚Äúfind female yoga instructors who live in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.‚Äù

**Why is now a good time to get involved?**
Snovio claims to have 800,000 contacts collected through decentralized data collection with focus now on collecting data and growing their registered users. The market cap is relatively low with the token being live on kucoin. 

As always DYOR, and I would love to hear what other people think about the project. ",0.9365,daily_general_discussion_january_7_2018,0.011,0.912,0.077

286,"Since the gains have been so crazy and people are starting to worry about a crash or a race to the exit, i'm going to say that's not going to happen this week or next week. 
This entire market is hinged on Bitoin's performance. Last 'crash' at the end of december came after the end of Bitcoin's 1.5month rally towards 20K. On the chart you can easily see the tipping point where the rally stopped and Bitcoin started a downtrend, failing to make higher highs and also starting to make lower lows. After a couple failed breakthrough attempts it really started to flush down, taking the entire market down. 
Bitcoins consolidation period has only just ended (2 days ago), coupled with a daily MACD cross. It's almost guaranteed to have started it's next bull run towards 22k-25k. This might have short term negative effects on alts but they seem to recover almost instantly. We will see a correction if Bitcoin's rally fails but i seriously doubt it. 

Next weeks will be total bonkers. December will probably pale in comparison to what's about to happen in the coming months. The crypto bubble is far from bursting, everyone very much underestimates how much dormant capital is lying around in the world. The market cap will easily reach 10T in the coming year.  There is no fucking limit on how high this can go (compared to traditional stocks where there actually is a limit due to economic indicators like P/E ratio's). When someone says it's overvalued or undervalued, they are automatically wrong because we have not found any method yet to actually value crypto's, unless you compare the value between crypto's. The nominal value of derivatives in the world is estimated at 1.2 quadrillion (probably a gross overstatement and a bad comparison but a man can dream). Let that sink in for a moment.

We are still far away from large investment bank ETF's where they actually buy Bitcoins or Ethereum. But it will come, they will never let all this money lying around. The problem right now is that exchanges aren't safe enough yet to be buying Bitcoins by the millions. UI interfaces for wallets are way tooo complex for the average Wall Street trading desk. But this will change, eventually. (definitely keep an eye out for investment opportunities in this niche market). Goldman Sachs has already announced they will put up a trading desk by the summer. 
Things are about to get a lot more crazy!

293,"I want to take some time and provide a little information on some of the popular coins I have seen mentioned in this feed and like many others have bought into. Today I want to highlight the Bounty0x project. 

**What does it do?**
Bounty0x is looking to create a decentralized platform for individuals to complete tasks and get paid in tokens. It is targeted to the current startup scene around ICOs. It is looking to be the go to platform for freelancers and startups in cryptocurrency. The main comparison currently would be ethlance. 

**How is the token used?**
The BNTY token is a utility token that will be used in the platform to stake in order to make proposals (bounty hunters), post jobs (bounty hosts), or review jobs (bounty sheriffs). You will be required to stake some portion of the tokens when making a submission to ensure quality job posts, submissions, and reviews. A portion of the staked tokens are burned when the submissions do not meet the requirements.  Bounty is one of the first projects built on the district0x (DNT) network which aims to be the platform for dapps. 

**Why is now a good time to get involved?**
Bounty0x has an Alpha version of the platform with 750k in bounties posted. The roadmap points to Q1 releasing the ability to stake BNTY as a bounty hunter or sheriff to make submissions and review tasks. This will allow you to earn more tokens by completing tasks and contributing to the cryptocurrency community as a whole. I would encourage you to check out the alpha platform and review some of the current posted tasks. Also the market cap pretty with a lot of room for growth. 

Take some time to look into projects and as always don‚Äôt just take other‚Äôs word on projects but DYOR. Hopefully someone finds this useful, and I would love to hear others thoughts on the project. ",0.983,daily_general_discussion_january_7_2018,0.0,0.884,0.116

318,"DBC has been a steady gainer since it was released on Kucoin. Best investment I've made since XRP's run.

It's a Chinese based project, and will be released on Huobi this month (no official date). Backed by NEO and Chinese, tech-oriented VCs. DeepBrain has huge past and current tech clients - Lenovo, Microsoft, Control4, Siemens, etc. If all goes well with DBC development and testing, they'll be able to upgrade DeepBrain systems (already in use) with blockchain solutions.

Q&A with creator for those interested (mentions of working with Microsoft and other large tech companies): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcYeO5e6EI0

Use cases of DeepBrain products with huge clients: http://deepbrain.ai/web/index?type=1

This is the definition of good team with a successful history (working in AI and cloud computing since 2012), and they have plenty of potential use cases considering the cliental already using their DeepBrain products.

**What does the project aim to do?**
Honestly there are similarities with the Bounty0x project in my opinion. CanYa is aiming to be a peer to peer platform for users to pay for and perform services. It sounds like the aim is to be the task rabbit of crypto. 

**What is the token used for?**
The token is used as the escrow service to perform the task. It will hold the token in a contract until the service is complete and then released to the person performing the task. The white paper states the CAN tokens then can be automatically exchanged for ETH/BTC and sent to your wallet

Hard to tell on current market cap as it is just getting to exchanges post ICO. A little perspective - the white paper states that there will be 100 million tokens in circulation(not sure about current circulation). The quick math would mean that at 1$ a coin the market cap would be roughly $100 mill or around 200 in coin market cap. Right around where Bounty0x is. Keep this in mind as it hits the exchange and depending on the price could be primed for a good pump. It looks like it is currently going for around 3$ a coin. The roadmap has March 2018 as the target date for the platform release. 

As always DYOR and would love to hear your thoughts on the project.

* BTC is flawed and quite possibly unsustainable as a global currency. However it has a huge and fanatical following that will not give up on it easily. I guess they are trying to fix the issues like high fees and slow transaction confirmations with things like Segwit and lightning network. I don't know enough about these yet to know if they will save BTC, but it seems like there are plenty of other Cryptos that are doing it better already.

* Mercatox and Coinbase are shit.

* XRP is owned by the bankers and is heavily centralized, which completely defeats the purpose of the cryptocurrency movement.

* ETH has some amazing utility and is the safest and steadiest gaining coin to buy.

* TRON is a scam. 

* XRB has amazing potential as a simple currency for everyday buy/sell transactions, but it is doing it so radically differently that people don't trust it.

* The white paper is 61 pages and very technical and detailed.
* Very unique use case, one of a kind so far
* Decentralized search framework
* Active GitHub repo, over 800 commits
* 100,000,000 total tokens
* From the team that brought us NEO

Technically experience team: 

* Hitters Xu (NEO founder) 
* Robin Zhong (Architect of NEO Blockchain Platform) 
* Aero Wang (NEO co-founder) 
* Duran Lui, Head of Engineering  (6+ years as Senior Software Engineer at Google) 
* Qi Zhu, (Engineering Manager at Airbnb) 
* Larry Wang, (Senior Software Engineer at Alibaba) 
* Plus 8 more experience team members 

Also hiring for 5 Senior Software Engineer positions

To me it looks like the Nebulas team is more focused on creating an amazing product and not focused so much on marketing. For that reason I believe that NAS has flown under the radar and is really undervalued.

Bithumb might enable trading with zero fees. This open the door for creating a huge volume of trading for some coins. 
Since CMC calculating the price as a weighted average of the volume, and since Korea prices are usually higher, if you want to pump your coin price on CMC, all you have to do is create a fake volume on Bithumb. 
See for example: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ripple/#markets
p.s. I saw in the past CMC taking out of the calculation Bithumb for ETH, but for some reason it doesn't do it for XRP for example now, even that it has huge impact on the price.

867,"Hi guys, just wanted to share my crypto investor stages with you. I am curious if any of you has gone through the same phases:

Phase 1. Noob
Invested in ripple because the price was low and thought it will reach 20k just as bitcoin did and I will be a millionaire. Still got lucky though. Profits: initial investment x 8

Phase 2. Day trader
Started reading more, aknowledged circulating supply,  sold almost all my ripple and started trowing money around on shilled coins on reddit. Lost about 25% of my portfolio but my biggest accomplishment at this stage was that I realised that I cannot ride every single coin mooning on the market.

Phase 3. Hodler
Learned my lesson and started to look for coins that can offer me a more stable growth and covered 60% of my portfolio with them. Seen a slow but stable growth. 

Phase 4. Researcher
I have started reading about the technology and looked at tens of websites, teams, whitepapers, github repositories, blogs etc and spread my remaining 40% of my portfolio into projects I really believe in. Today I have reached my ATH again

Future phase: Phase 5. Microcap investor
The plan is to take my profits out of my investments and get out there with a metal stick when it rains outside hoping i will get struck by lightning. That means buying large amounts of coins in alts that I will consider really undervaluated with a really low marketcap.

Which phase are you guys on? Is there any other phase that I skipped?

- Another bull market to September
- one mini bear market to mid September
- and one enormous bull market to present day

When do you expect an overall market correction/bear market?

If/when it happens, how low can you see the total marketcap dropping to?

I'm not going to shill any coins in this post. But I own a handful of alts that have been stagnant or have had minimum growth in the last week. And you know what, I'm ok with it. If you believe in the product and the team, then you won't feel bad about holding it when there is a dip. The good tech will win out in the long run, and you will make money off of it. Day trading shit coins is normally not worth it. It is much easier to be a bagholder and have strong hands on a great product than it is to be a bag holder on a shitcoin that you know nothing about.

So, with BTC acting like a bull in a china shop, I decided to consolidate my sats into a fewer coins.  I am now 50% in FUN, 20% in VTC, 20% in PAY, and 10% in MONA.  

FUN has basically held up, and even increased in value through this BTC pump.  They are releasing the Beta of the Casino in Feb, and are scheduled to go live in June.  

VTC just bottomed out at 37k last night, and has been on a upward trend since. They are scheduled to release Vertbase on 3/31, and are expected to be added to a few new exchanges soon.  

TenX (PAY) cards are shipping world wide starting in Jan.  I believe it bottomed out at 20k last night, and is now heading back up.   EDIT: looks like TenX is having problems with VISA, so maybe this is a gamble.  However, holding doesn't seem to risky since I bought in at 20k.

MONA is way down from the previous pump from Japan.  Like any favorite pumpers coin, it is now overdue to be pushed back up.  So, this one is a bit more of a gamble.

What do you think about Vericoin VRC and (Verium VRM)?

I think their ideas and business has a solid base, but they need to do lot of marketing and get some partners. I believe when this happens it will have a nice booming growth!

1585,"Hey everyone,

I don't know if anybody will see this post on such a large thread but I wanted to bring up a discussion about current crypto valuations and the upward trend in total market cap.

Does anyone here have an argument for whether or not the current market cap is reasonable/unreasonable?  Given the trend, the top 5 in mcap are nearing some of the largest US companies in market cap.  And though it's been voiced many times, I'm beginning to worry about the gold mine rush vibe crypto is generating.  

Can anyone reasonably discuss why they think the current mcap is justifiable?  Either sides are welcome, I'm just curious whether anyone else here is concerned about this.  Whether you believe in your given coin or not, tech isn't really what I'm talking about here.  Tech aside, this is still being treated as a market and the growth of this market seems too good.  I've gained a lot from it, but it's still something I think is worth discussing. ",0.9372,daily_general_discussion_january_6_2018,0.039,0.837,0.124

Binance also just closed registrations, so Bittrex and Binance are now gone to new people. Meaning KuCoin is the next place to go for new coins. If you look at BNB over the last week, it went from 8$ to 18$.... There is potential yet.

2. Only affiliation between him and Jack Ma is he graduated from Jack Ma's University, most probably have read forbes.com article shilling him as the 'next jack ma'

3. The coins 'locked' are not governed by a smart contract, can be withdrawn anytime. Doesn't give any convincing reason why a smart contract wasn't created. 

4. I mean who buys his bullshit explanation that a private investor just coincidentally had the same name, used justinpets, and is dumping BILLIONS of tron just to be a 'market maker'.

Use the blockchain to host entire websites to create a decentralized internet.

Similar to how SIA allows people to store data like they would in a google drive, except use this decentralized storage to store websites.
Combine this with Golem-like tech to allow for what would normally be server side code (php) to be executed.

All website data can be stored in a decentralized fashion, when someone visits the site data (html, javascript, php code, images etc.) can be loaded from decentralized storage and ""miners"" would execute the server side php code, essentially creating a decentralized internet.

Not everything would be stored directly on the blockchain as is with the Ethereum Virtual Machine,  but the blockchain would function similar to SIA except also allowing for php code execution.

AppCoin (APPC) just got listed on Binance about 6 hours ago, and is done with the usual ""ICO dump"" after being listed.


It goes for ~$2 at the moment, and has potential to hit the $10 it got listed at, in about two weeks (check ARN or OST which is also relatively new listings, that followed same curve)


The coin is made by Aptoide, which is one of the worlds biggest third party appstores. It has a total supply of only 250m.


They have Key Advisors from Google Play, Goldman Sachs, TenX, Bitcoin Core and Ripple Core.


Their goal is to change the way people pay for apps, and give the developers more freedom and transparency.

Background: I bought into ETH somewhat recently with a relatively small stack of under 0.25 ETH. I have been ""day/week trading"" to increase my total holdings. 

Claim: ""Day/week trading"" will give me a better chance at reaching my ""moon"" by regularly increasing my total number of ETH.

Reason: Seeing as we are in the early stages of crypto the majority of these coins/tokens will not exist in the next 5 years. With my relatively small stack it is hard to diversify without spreading myself too thin. Any long term gains on these small initial investments would be tiny.

Plan: Continue to ""day/week trade"" until my holdings become a factor of ETH rather than a fraction of ETH.

2557,"To address a lot of the worrying things I'm seeing in this thread from complete investing newbies...

1. If you aren't prepared for the price to go down, 40, 60, or even 100% then you should not be invested in cryptocurrencies, let alone risky small cap investments. If you want to play in this space you have to be absolutely sure that when you see this happen, you don't panic, evaluate the situation as a whole, and remember what the goals of your trade were in the first place. This is partially why it's so important to invest in stuff you believe in and understand...when the weather gets bad you want to make sure you can withstand the storm because you believe it will end eventually. And if you fancy yourself a day trader, then before you get into a trade make sure you have set goals and stop losses, otherwise your floundering with no plan.

2. If you're putting money in thinking it's just always going to go up. Days like this are normal in all markets, and while it sucks to feel like you're losing money the ultimate lesson an investor can learn is patience. Because it seems to me many of the people who post here have never invested in other markets and expect everything to go up 100% a week. Crypto moves faster than any market, and what seems like a disaster today could be completely forgotten in three. 

3. STOP TRADING TO FOMO. Everyone keeps asking if they should trade all their down alts to go for BTC...WHY? You're trading in your assets at a discount to buy an asset at a premium. Just because you feel like you're missing out, don't chase it. Read this thread or any other to see countless stories of people selling to chase a new coin, only to have the coin they just sold rise 50% over the next day. In crypto, if you believe in the project, hold tight. The majority of active traders lose money.

4. There are two types of people you can be here. For example, in a month when XLM crosses a dollar there is going to be one person saying ""thank god I bought that dip at 62"" and one person saying ""well got in at 1.01, hope this works out"". Which do you want to be?

5. It's a lot easier to hold something if you believe in it. So if you're just here buying coins that you don't understand with no real value, it's going to be a lot harder when you see it go down to sit tight. 

6. You should always have some ETH and BTC in your portfolio. The fact that many of you view them as ""boring"" is extremely worrisome. A stock portfolio returning 30% in a year would be absolutely killing it, but you think that if bitcoin only goes up 100% it's a total waste. If you want to be in the crypto market, make sure you hedge a bit. As BTC goes up, Alts tend to go down.

7. Be careful of the excessive shilling that occurs here and on other forums. Many of the coins are shilled but for good reasons, but many more are people just trying to suckers other into buying because they are nervous they made a bad decision. With that being said, some of the coins you've been reading here a lot DO have a bright future, and can be considered ""Safer"" picks in such a crazy market, i.e. REQ VEN XMR NEO XLM. Do your research on this coins. Research the team, research the product, research the potential use cases and potential amount of users. If you believe it, buy it. 

Anyone just wanted to vent and hopefully help some people from making some bad choices. Just my 2cents.

You can spend 14 hours a day on your computer with all your exchanges open trying to time the market, selling when you anticipate a crash and hoping to re-buy later (though this can be disastrous if you time things incorrectly or get tricked into believing a daily dip is an all-out crash).

2603,"I have been lurking around the crypto community for a while, but I wanted to encourage people to think of their coin portfolios the same as their stock portfolios... meaning think in terms of risk! Coin trading seems to be where the stock market was 50 years ago. There is a lot to learn from some of the institutions to investing. For coins, I would characterize risk in terms of how long it has been trading, if there is a true use-case, and are there any shortcomings within the coin. To break it down a bit:

Low Risk (Low Reward) - These coins probably won't plummet anytime soon, but they aren't going to go crazy either. In the stock market these would be your blue chip stocks (think Ford or Walmart) in coin terms I think it would be BTC, maybe ETH (but that is almost in a low-moderate risk category).

Moderate Risk / Moderate Reward - These coins are relatively well established. They have some track history, but could go higher. This could also hold some of the up and coming coins, depending on where they are in the cycle. They could become established or they could be just the ""coin of the week.""

High Risk / High Reward - This is where the real shit coins come in. You could make bank, but there is a significantly higher likelihood you will lose it all. Shilling coins is great (but really, shut up already), but the sheer fact that someone is shilling a coin (and the fact that a crowd mentality follows) tends to make me put a coin in the high-risk category.

A good portfolio has a mix of the above. The exact mix is dependent on the willingness you are to lose your coins. Personally, I have a 50/40/10 portfolio.

Anyways, what do you guys consider in each category? I think this would also be a much more useful metric to newbies than general coin comparisons or shilling.

Not in a day, week, month, year. You can also use other options like Gemini, Bitstamp, Coinmama, or even local bitcoin if you are desperate. Coinbase just has the name but they are probably the most unorganized and crap company. The only thing good about them is if they add a coin 500,000,000 people buy it instantly.

1) Binance is growing exponentially and every large investor is going to want to hold some BNB to save on fees, which add up

2) Binance also uses 20% of quarterly profit to buy and burn BNB tokens, which will leave it at 100 million circulating tokens

I think these 2 reasons are what led to BNB going 400% in the past 2 weeks and the trend should continue upwards. I have most of my funds allocated to long term HODL coins already, but once i can get some fiat in I'd like to buy some BNB to hold as well.

If anyone has thoughts i'd like to hear them!

2826,"I tried to make a post about Gems Protocol but don't have enough comment karma to do it, so i'll copy paste it here, please help give me some comment karma if you support the research done:

The Gems Protocol is attempting to decentralize contracting workers for micro-tasks.

Overview: Currently there is a market ripe for disruption due to in-efficiencies of having a centralized market place for both requesters (people who need micro tasks completed) and miners (people who perform the micro tasks). The main inefficiencies are:

1. Large overhead costs. Amazon Mechanical Turk charges requesters a minimum of a 20% fee for any amount paid to miners, charging more for miners with good track records and more for tasks with 10 or more assignments, leading to fees of around 40%. Crowdflower, a recent VC competitor that raised nearly $60M, charges a $3k onboarding fee and $1.5k monthly recurring fee and a 15% charge. All of this puts downward pressure on the wages miners take home. GEMS changes this because their platform does not take ANY fees from either side.

2. Low Accessibility. Many potential miners do not have access to bank accounts and therefore cannot participate in the current micro task economy. GEMS are paid out on the blockchain so anyone with access to the blockchain can now receive access to payout. In addition, Mechanical Turk / Crowdflower requires identification verification, where as GEMS does not. It instead relies on a decentralized trust system based on how reliably previous tasks were completed. With two different layers, verifiers and requesters independently vetting each completed assignment, malicious actors or actors who perform poor quality work will be weeded out quickly. Since the trust score is designed to build slowly at the beginning, creating a new account / address would not be in any valid actor's best interest and would require too much effort for a malicious actor.

3. Bad Usability. Mechanical turk has a terribly unfriendly UI / UX. Many programs have to be built on top of it to make it accessible, also increasing the barrier to usage and increasing turn around time for tasks. GEMS will have interfaces called modules built on top for specific tasks to help aid the workers in completing their tasks. These will be open sourced.

By tackling these issues, GEMS can cut out the middle man and create an efficient micro task ecosystem. GEMS tokens have utility since miners are required to stake tokens before performing work to ensure quality results and to deter malicious actors and for requesters to pay miners.

2857,"Hello everyone, noobie here. Got into crypto around 2 weeks ago turning a 30% ROI so far. I was able to snag XRP at 1.01 and TRX at  . 06. Those are my biggest gains. I also hold a similar portfolio to most people here. I have ETH, LTC, VEN, REQ, IOTA, ICX, and XLM. I had XVG but sold to get more into XLM. My smallest holding by far is REQ. I have 3 questions.
1. Should I sell TRX?, I have heard a lot of bad comments and how it could be a huge scam.
2. What about Ripple? It was the first coin I bought and makes up around 50% of my portfolio. If so where should the gains go? I have heard VEN XLM ICX and REQ are set to have a big 2018.
3. What about my LTC? hodl? Or invest somewhere else?

Ether, OMG, GNT, ENG, LINK, IOTA

I feel like these are strong contenders for still being alive after the crash. 

Omg has it's own company and they will continue to develop throughout. 

Gnt actually has a use case and if they get brass up and running, its a strong contender. 

ENG,  a privacy protocol that is currency agnostic. I think this is essential for the ecosystem and they have a great team. Meaning,  most likely they have thought about the crash scenario. I have faith in them. 

Link, decentralized Oracle. Very underhyped as it is and constantly fudded cuz it doesn't give quick gains. Decentralized oracles are a must, if blockchain is to actually do something in the real world. Been in development since 2014. Small team, low costs. 

Iota, obviously fudded a shit ton. But I believe in the team and they are working towards a future economy. Other then a failure of execution, I think IOTA will be one of the strong ones after everything crashes.

3595,"Hi!‚ò∫ I have a stupid question, because I'm pretty new at this. üòú And please excuse this Swede, her rusty English. üòâ

The basic currency I'm trading for other coins, is ethereum. First of all, is that stupid? Because I've come to realise that it's pretty volatile. Is there a better ""Base"" currency, who is more stable then ethereum, so that the money I put in from CoinBase, don't lose their value, before I even trade ethereum for whatever other altCoin I actually want. (For example TRX.) Ethereum is just the medium, and it felt easiest, since I had to buy ethereum on CoinBase, to be able to send it to binance.

So now I've come to question whether I should trade the ethereum for something else more stable, the second it hits my ETH binance wallet? Because I want something that doesn't loose value, while I'm waiting for (let's say Trx) to hit my preferred price.

But then again, I'm wondering whether that is stupid? Because when ethereum skyrockets, and if the TRX is simultaneously low, I get alot more bang for my buck!

But then again, when ethereum is low, even if TRX is simultaneously low, I get alot less trx-coins.

If your advice is to keep ethereum as a Base currency, to trade for other coins, I have a second question. (I'm sorry for this novel length query.)üòä

Obviously as stated, it's a good deal to buy another altCoin, when ethereum is high, and the desired currency is low.

But how do I calculate what is more profitable? I'm gonna use TRX in this example. Sometimes Ethereum is low, and TRX is also low, but because you can't know, how long TRX is gonna stay low, you might want to buy it at the advantageous TRX-price.. Even if the low Ethereum gives me less coins.

Because if I wait, TRX will surely rise alot, and I might miss out. But as the TRX rises, so might the ethereum.. there is obviously a magical line, when it becomes more profitable to buy TRX, even at a high price, because the higher ETHprice covers the difference, and gives me more coins.

But sometimes the heightened price of TRX, cancels out the gain, when TRX becomes more expensive, even if ETH has risen too, but not enough to be profitable. It of course depends on the numbers. But how do I calculate that? How do I know?

How do I know, at what magical line, the risen ETHprice keeps up, or even surpasses how many coins I would have gotten at the low TRX price? How do I calculate which is more valuable?

If I have the choice, of course I buy when TRX is low, and ETH is high. But if I don't have that choice..

How do I calculate if it's more profitable to buy, when both ETH and TRX are low, or when both ETH or TRX are high? Because of course it varies, depending on the numbers. Is there some sort of formula, a trick, or some really smart tip?

Please help this Swedish newbie. üòä

Ps. This is a REALLY stupid question. üòä When I make an order, (stoplimit) to buy a coin when it reaches a certain price.. Do I lock in the current value of ethereum (the currency I'm buying WITH) or will I when the sale happens (possible a few hours from when I put in the stoplimit) get whatever value for my ethereum, as it currently stands on the market? Since you put in the order, with a fixed number of coins, I would assume I lock in the current ethereum price, and that it doesn't change when the sale happens, even if the ethereum might have lost or gained value since I put in the order?

That is of course the logical answer, I guess I just need it confirmed. I started trading like two days ago, so I'm not quite an expert yet. üòâ",0.9807,daily_general_discussion_january_5_2018,0.078,0.806,0.116

3650,"I posted this on the main board and didn't get much feedback, so I was wondering what folks here thought:

I‚Äôve been digging into CRED/Verify a bit lately and am definitely going to invest and here‚Äôs why (sorry for the shill, but I'm looking to get feedback / thoughts / discussion going):

1. The technology is brand new and it hasn‚Äôt taken off yet. This makes it an obvious good opportunity for investing. 

2. The technology is perfect for lenders on things such as the Bloom ecosystem for decentralized credit scoring (which is another piece of tech that I think is going to be the future of crypto). The built in scoring mechanism would make this technology a perfect fit for peer2peer lenders, with the ability to setup automatic payments and feeding the resulting scores into Bloom. 

3. Having a system with scoring and guaranteed payments mixed with something like REQ would allow for a full point of sale software built on crypto. With the lack of POS software for crypto as is, this could allow crypto to gain some real traction and use in the real world. And as previously mentioned, it could feed into Bloom as a factor for credit scoring.

Still a big barrier to picking this up as you need to get it on Kucoin but no coincidence that Binance have announced they're working on NEP5 token support and had this listed in their coin of the month competition. Including it in the competition vote must mean they're ready to list NEP5 tokens and you don't spend time and effort of dev not to use it.

3700,"**A comment I wrote about ($BAT) that I think may be informative**

I do digital marketing and have over 4 years (not much by industry standards) experience in Google and Facebook ad platforms, I'll be interested in seeing how I can use their platform to better target and maximise the ad spend I'm putting through using BAT. Also right now, pixels and scripts are a convulated mess in adding to websites. Some sites make it easy such as shopify, but if you roll your own it becomes increasing difficult, especially the more unusual your site design is.

I hope to see BAT simplify this process and ensure my ad spend is actually on the right people viewing and interacting with my ads.

The adspend industry is sorely in need of something that ensures their ad spend is happening on people that actually interact and care about what they are seeing. I run $300/day on ad spend combined for my two eCommerce stores, and i'd love to know that money was more effectively spent, conversion data simply isn't enough nowadays, advertisers such as myself need a platform that is proactive in ensuring ads are seen by the right people.

Will this replace Google Adwords and Facebook Ads? No, will advertisers use this alongside current marketing efforts? Yes. And if BAT proves to generate a positive ROI on ad spend, the sky is the limit with how much BAT will grow. Just look at how much Google and Facebook make from advertising.

It is such a difficulty nowadays to ensure your ads are going to the right people. A platform that works actively to ensure its spent where it counts on people that have a % chance to buy from you is so important.

I see the current form of BAT in the brave browser as a showcase of what is to come. Like most advertiser tools, they usually present themselves in the form of apps and plugins. I see BAT taking mainstream usage when it is developed it apps that can be installed onto sites allowing them to take advantage of the BAT platform, and plugins in browsers such as Chrome and Mozilla (which are being developed, the founder of BAT cofounded Mozilla and JAVA).

In general crypto is young. But if you want to know where innovation occurs in any business, look to the advertising space. Advertising is one of the few industries where businesses look to maximise spend, not minimise it (e.g. accounting, administrative expenses), and try new things.

In my stores I look for ways to maximise my spend. There is no limit to how much I am willing to spent if for every $1 I receive $1.01. This is the nature of the adspace, and BAT can take advantage of this lucrative industry.

Where Blockchain comes in is with the ability to offer new solutions to current advertising problems. The tools we use at the moment while still cutting edge are growing old and stale, advertisers are always on the forefront of trying new things out (imagine if you were the first to utilise Google Adwords or FB ads in the beginning for an ecommerce store while only a few started).

I believe BAT is going to offer a new edge for advertisers to take advantage of, there is a massive incentive in this industry for early adopters of new tech, and with all such cases, it will then transition into mainstream usage.",0.9968,daily_general_discussion_january_5_2018,0.03,0.828,0.142

3920,"noob wallet question, ELI5 please!

I have a Ledger Nano S I'm setting up. From the Ledger FAQ's is this in the introductory description: 

""The main principle behind hardware wallets is to provide a full isolation between the cryptographic secrets (private keys) and your easy to hack computer or smartphone.""

My question is, given that I have to plug in my Ledger to my computer each time I want to spend coins in my wallet, doesn't that open opportunities for hacking/malware? (is there no way for malware to detect keys on a device connected by USB?) 

I trust that these work but I'm missing something when it comes to being 'safe' when plugged into my computer via USB (especially given that the wallet navigation is on my computer via the Chrome wallet extension) .

Posting here as the daily‚Äôs for 6th and 7th are not showing on my feed and I do not have the karma to post on the skeptics feed. 

For many of the many commenters focusing on the decline of ad revenue due to ad blockers as the source of success for PRL, this ignores the fundamental truth that only a very small percentage of ad revenue comes from traditional banner ads that blockers are most effective at disabling. The vast majority of digital media dollars are being spent on video or native formats that ad blockers are much less proficient at identifying as advertising. Digital advertising is an industry on the upswing, not the decline. 

And even digital banner spend is still increasing, despite the presence of ad blockers, as the rapid and continuous evolution of programmatic advertising continues to deliver new efficiencies to marketers media budgets. While this may not be directly translating to increased revenue for the largest digital publishers, overall, the total spend across the web is still increasing.

Then to take those coins and store them on some kind of storage (cold, hardware, I don't know)... what's best?

Then I would basically create a portfolio (to monitor their values).

Another thing to mention is that I won't be buying all 5-10 coins at once so I want to avoid constantly moving from cold storage to an exchange (back and forth - unless I understand this wrong)

SDTV is an infinitely better investment than TRON at this point. Anyone who understands both projects and knows the facts will come to this conclusion.",0.81,daily_general_discussion_january_5_2018,0.0,0.923,0.077

4483,"Hey guys

I‚Äôd like to present you my next high-risk, high-reward project. I‚Äôm talking about BitBoost.
CMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitboost/
HP: https://www.bitboost.net/

What is BitBoost?
The BitBoost project exists to create a decentralized marketplace. You can compare it with eBay or Amazon. The buyer and seller are both completely anonymous, hidden bu the TOR-Network. The Token is called BBT.

Aims of the project
- decentralized marketplace with no censorship
- abolition of huge fees (like on eBay)
- giving access to a marketplace, no matter where you live
- total anonymity with the help of the TOR-Network
- a marketplace build on bilateral trust

The Token
The marketplace is accessible through a downloadable application called The Block. The Block is powered by the Ethereum network and will use an ERC20 token called BBT. BBT is needed to set-up a listing. The seller will need to pay 1 USD equivalent in BBT (no annoying 10% cuts to 3rd party) and the listing will be written into the blockchain. This will be the only fee.

4,862,878 BBT were sold during the ICO. A total supply is given by 100‚Äô000‚Äô000 altough it‚Äôs officially confirmed that the remaining tokens are locked away to reevaluate the crypto market situation in a year. The team will decide, if they‚Äôll do an airdrop or token burning. A part of it will be used for marketing, coin-exchange listing fees and future development.

Why I like this project
I have several reasons to do so.

1. The team:
16 people are working on the project and the CEO holds two master‚Äôs degrees form Harvard. 
They didn‚Äôt shill the project once; they‚Äôre even against it. They want to deliver first although they‚Äôve already worked for 2 years on The Block.

2. The product:
The Block is already in the BETA. What does it mean? This project has a working product and has still a sub 10 million market cap! I don‚Äôt want to drop some names but we all know that we have projects in the top20 which are vapor ware. And look at the White paper, it‚Äôs rock solid.

3. The community:
The Telegram group has already over 1000 members which support BitBoost without a doubt. The devs are also active on the channel. Link: t(.)me(/)BitBoostint

4. Potential:
If we look at similar projects, we see for example SysCoin with a cap of 400 million USD. If this project will perform well and reaches only 25% you still have 10x-ed your money. BitBoost will release the live version of The Block in Q2 2018. In this time, they‚Äôll start to market the product.
So why should you buy now? The team is about to make new announcements and BBT will hit new exchanges soon (probably next week).	",0.859,daily_general_discussion_january_5_2018,0.046,0.881,0.073

4614,"Tired of Binance and Bittrex not listing smaller cap coins? Get Kucoin before they close registration due to the amount of new sign ups you're getting.
Kucoin also has Kucoin Shares (KCS). Many people buy KCS valuing it in terms of the current dividends they get without considering the future.

I currently get $5 a day from my 3.2k KCS, but say KCS trading volume does 10x this year, it now becomes $50 a day. Yet it doesn't stop there. 
Say the value of coins rises another 10x over the year on average which is conservative, the accumulated dividend is actually 100x so now I get $500 a day and can retire. 
There are so many multipliers at play here that I think KCS is still undervalued given that it seems Kucoins is going to keep growing as well as the total crypto market.


heres a pasta:
>50% of all fee income is distributed to kcs holders. You can do math at pic related.
>Kucoin is still small compared to binance or bittrex. It WILL catch uo. Binance closed new registers, and all US exchanges are fucked in general.
>Half of all coins are locked up until 2019 at minimum. Founder coins are locked up until 2021. So worst case, sell in 2019.
>The sooner you get in, the bigger the piece of the pie you get. Im currently getting a nice dividend of every single coin. The diversification and minimization of beta is obviously a good padding to my portfolio.
>The development team is great. Look into them. Very experienced and strong backgrounds.
>Most importantly, they have clearly shown they are dedicated for the long haul. They have been upgrading servers. They have their coins locked up. 
>They will soon introduce a platform where people can trade ANY PAIR. 
>Its like binance coin, but 10x more profitable, and is currently only 10% of the size.
>By 2020, this exchange will be one of the five monoliths of crypto.

4663,"I'm sorry if this comment does not meet your taste, it aimed mostly for those that love digging into facts and knowning the truth behind some coins. I'm posting it here since I do not have enough karma to post it on the appropriate discussion.

I've made similar posts with facts only for them to be removed/filtered out at the Vergecurrency subreddit. I know some people can become very fanatic with their beliefs (religions and soccer are proof of this) but I can do nothing more than present them the facts and let them decide by themselves.

In my linked comment below you can see facts taken from the source code of the verge project where the team copy pasted the 3years old code from OpalCoin that contains the feature of Stealth Addresses AS IS, without even modifying it to the extend that even the error messages would display OpalCoin instead of Verge. You would think there is some testing before publishing on master branch.. Unless the developers are happy with their users seeing Opalcoin in their Verge software. What makes it even worse is that OpalCoin 4clause BSD license requires any party that uses their code to give them credit in advertisement material, something that never happened from the Verge team. This is in contrast with how the open source world works. See for your self here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/vergecurrency/comments/7nu1ll/verge_marketing_making_big_changes_15_tweets_in_4/ds4xs53/

Another guy did a similar research and published his results on a github issue. He points out several occasions where the Verge team copy pasted code from many other coins AS IS, without testing, without again modifying again the names and the titles. He only got attacked and the issue was marked as spam.

Disclaimer: I'm not saying you are not allowed to ""reuse"" code from open source projects, the point is that everyone believes the Verge team is ""hard working"", they worked their asses off during new years eve to produce a release and people idolise them like gods while the truth is that the hard work has been done by the teams of the other coins who never received any credits and the Verge team is working hard to resolve bugs they themselves introduced by blindly copying the code, not even testing it and publishing it to the world.

Got a big chunk to blow that I want to increase before APEX (CPX) drops on exchanges in march.

So, mid term hold is okay. Short term gain is good too. I already have plenty of long term hold, and thinking about these two coins to invest in until march, although any other recommendations are welcome!

I'm thinking of either adding to my position for BNTY, or diving into DBC.

I looked at DBC, and It's interesting. Although their website is a bit laggy. BNTY really shines in the space of it's design and marketing, not to mention it's unique niche.

DBC is a more serious project however, and I've been seeing it shilled.

BNTY has a lower market cap, and a lower circulating supply.

Although I'm loving the gains made recently (XRP, TRX...), I can't help but feel that this insane growth is not normal, that the market will regulate itself sooner or later and that a crash is incoming. I'm still a bit new to the crypto game, but I noticed that the total Crypto market cap multiplied nearly 8 times (x 8 !!!) over the last 3 months, compared to x2 since Nov-13 till Nov-17.

A total market cap of 800 billion is still not that high when you consider that Google market cap is equal to that alone, but it's the crazy total growth over the last 2 months that got me worried.

What do you think ? Will the next crash be a big one or will we experience a series of 'simple' regulating crashes (like the one that happened on the third week of December last year)followed by more growth over the next year?

5055,"So one thing that doesn't seem to make much sense to me (here come the FUD accusations) is how some of these crypto currencies that are tied to some real world assets, such as siacoin or the upcoming DADI, actually have increasing value. Isn't the theoretical maximum value of these coins just going to be equivalent to whatever their competitor pricing will be in real world dollars?

For example, sia claims that their cost for 5TB of storage per month is $10, while the closest competitor is Amazon S3 at $115 per month (not including bandwidth costs). How can they claim that cost per TB when the cost will change with the fluctuation of the currency? Additionally, doesn't this mean that the maximum value for the coin will be equivalent to purchasing 5 TB of storage on amazon? Otherwise you would just and pay for stage with amazon as it would be cheaper, yes?

Mined coins seem to have a theoretical minimum value (the amount paid in electricity to mine), but no theoretical maximum. Coins backed up by real world assets, such as storage space (saiacoin) or processing time (the upcoming DADI does this, as far as I can tell) have no minimum, but do have a theoretical maximum.

Other coins based on real world work (such as revain) also confuse me a bit, as I can't determine what their values should really be.

So I guess can someone explain how some of these coins that are representative of real world assets be valued at more than the value of the asset offered by competitors, or is that the theoretical value limit?

No FUD, just a confused newbie trying to figure this crypto thing out. Also, full disclosure, I own no saiacoin, but I do have XML which from the rumors sounds like it will be associated with DADI.

1. A bank using ripple net does not mean buying ripple coins. But many people seem confused.

2. Majority of ripple coins are owned by a private company. I don't know how it is a good way to become a public currency.

3. The notion of banks' cryptocurrency has conflict with the essential value of cryptocurrency. Probably the top reason why crypto is an innovation is that we don't need an intermediary to send money. Though I think financial services will exist even when crypto becomes mainstream, 'crypto for banks' may be a good interim strategy? I have to think. But it is definitely not the best vision.

4. Ripple seems quite good as a currency. I hear it is fast with low fees. But is this a decentralized currency? Or at least a part if this comes from centralization? I want to know.",0.8037,daily_general_discussion_january_4_2018,0.077,0.793,0.13

But now it looks like they're putting a lot of their resources into hiring a new team according to the lead dev Bruno.

(source: https://www.reddit.com/user/oysterbruno)

I've been seeing this coin shilled quite a bit on these threads recently, which is somewhat concerning. But given the transparency of the founders (very active on reddit) and the efforts they're making to expand their development team, I now went ahead and threw some of my money behind the project. Interested to see how it goes in the future, and at this small of a market cap I am somewhat excited to see what my returns might be (BAT is a somewhat similar project and has a market cap 13x larger, so assuming all goes well it's *possible* that anything invested today may see 13x returns in the future).

5578,"Some (relatively) low cap coins with imo enourmous potential, and why. Let me hear what you think!

Publica (PBL) Rank 301 - $1,91

Trying to change the publishing industry through presaled coins (non tradeable) by authors to enalbe selfpublishing, cutting away publishers that leave authors with only a small share of the revenues. In essence, the PBL token is a decentralised crypto-currency that provides a convenient way to verify ownership of books and myriad other publications, and at the same time avoid the clutches of the traditional publishing industry
After huge gains yesterday (+80%), this coin had a small correction today, brilliant time to buy. And the team behind this is incredible, very experienced, big boys who led major companies. 

Pure (PURE) Rank 412 - $5,06

PURE is a new cryptocurrency that aims to purify the blockchain, with fresh ideas and clear vision toward a fair and truly decentralized usage and a better tomorrow. Pure is an Open source, Peer to Peer coin that supports Masternodes, and anonymous transactions.
A new anon coin that supporters masternodes and anonymous transactions. This coin can only go one way and that is up. Same story as Publica, huge gains yesterday, small dip (-5%) today, good time to shop.

Flixxo Rank 343 - $0,345889 USD
Decentralized video distribution network, where users will be the owners and beneficiaries of their content. Flixxo eliminates intermediaries by letting advertisers, viewers, and content creators engage with each other directly.
The brilliant thing about this team is that the creater of Popcorntime is in it. That is something that I would mark as very interesting. 

Last but not least: Etherparty (FUEL) - $0,412059 - Rank 126
This is not actually low cap, but this is a absolute brilliant project. 
Their goal is easy smart contract creation. To enable smaller companies to use smartcontracts. Their platform is already running and looks incredibly easy to use and straightforward. As a believer in smartcontracts I think this project will skyrocket and the rapid increase of value of this coin shows that I might not be far off. 

Furthermore I am a huge fan of LAToken, I really think this coin is going places! But this coin is getting a lot of attention lately and several youtube video's explain it's potential (or you could just read the whitepaper ofcourse). It is low cap aswell.

5681,"Has anyone considered the impact this flood of money into the crypto space is going to have on the stock market? We are overdue for a correction and as investors become less fearful of this volatile market, they seem to be dumping money into cryptospace instead of businesses. Without a doubt we are heading into some crazy times. Profits this huge and tech this new has got to have some deeply felt ramifications. 

Every extreme rise is coupled with a corresponding violent fall historically and although many of these coins are ""hodl for lifers"" it may only take a small amount of time to displace the top coins with newer ones with better groundwork and connections. Take a look at the top 10 coins 3 months ago and where we are today.

Tech is becoming more advanced every second - the largest known mass of minds since the beginning of time is putting heads together to create things we cannot even imagine... Remember when the Razor cell phone was the hottest phone on the market? Just over 10 years ago - and look where we are today. 

My advise would be: 

1. Don't get to comfortable 
2. Get everyone you know to invest in crypto
3. Keep your eyes open
4. Reconsider ""hodl""
5. Get rich now

Shit is about to get cray - exchanges are backed up and many are not even accepting new account requests. Hundreds of thousands (guess) of poor slobs are in the same situation I was last month - got a couple or a fraction of BTC, LTC and ETH waiting in escrow before they can pounce on low priced coins like Tron, Lumens, Cardano and Ripple.

My bet would be with Tron, but what do I know. Read the Whitepaper

Did I hear Ripple might be added to Coinbase....? That Amazon is looking?

I'm thinking it would be difficult if something had a refundable deposit (like a cruise) where the customer pays in XRB and then cancels and asks for their deposit back. If we'd already converted the XRB to Fiat, how would we handle the refund (would the customer demand an equal amount of XRB as a refund, or maybe we'd have to set ground-rules that we only do the exchange at the current XRB-fiat exchange rate).

6567,"I'm pulling my hair out trying to figure out the capital gains for my taxes this year. I've tried uploading data from Kraken and Coinbase into Bitcoin.tax, but it's not quite working out as simply as it seems to for others.

2016 was my first year playing with Crypto and I bought from three different exchanges and was shifting BTC and ETH around a lot. I played around with selling on Localbitcoins, moved money onto and off my hardware wallet, lent some BTC to a friend with a Bitcoin ATM for a few days... Basically I was having fun with this amazing new technology and not worried about keeping careful records.

Now I'm trying to figure out the cost basis of some crypto I sold last summer, and really having no fun at all.

So two part question:

Has anyone else successfully dealt with this level of complexity with their taxes?

Any tips for organizing things going forward?

FYI I'm mainly a HODLer, don't do any day trading, but I am planning to buy a bunch of different alts this year and hold them for a while.

6576,"Kennedy is the father of former president John F. Kennedy.

Joe made most of his money in the stock market. He traded stocks in the roaring 20s when there was little regulation and ""anything goes"" attitude surrounding all of Wall Street.

Joe famously avoided the Great Depression, and stock market crash of 1929. He sold his entire portfolio days before the crash. But how did he do it? This one anecdatoe explains it all:

""Joe Kennedy exited the stock market in timely fashion after a shoeshine boy gave him some stock tips. He figured that when the shoeshine boys have tips, the market is too popular for its own good.

A theory also advanced by Bernard Baruch, another vested interest who described the scene before the big Crash: ""Taxi drivers told you what to buy. The shoeshine boy could give you a summary of the day's financial news as he worked with rag and polish.

The worst part is that for many people this *is* the economy. The economy is to them a casino, rather than a productive engine.

Technological singularity people will say of course this is where things are headed. With scarcity solved the economy is just a game to be played, rather than a struggle for survival. The problem is that technological singularity people have been around since Marx, and have always been wrong.

As the name suggests, I‚Äôm new to this world but it isn‚Äôt a world I‚Äôm extremely Intrested in, and want to learn more and slowly make the jump investing

All of my free time at work and at home lately is just me reading up on bitcoin, crypto currency and other form of coins etc, but I think I‚Äôm jumping in at the deep end....

As an example, if I‚Äôm looking to buy stellar (XLM), from what I have read and understand you need to buy bitcoin and transfer them to a new wallet to buy? Everything seems to be aimed at the US market, what are the best UK wallets, be it online, desktop or phone, I know there are pros and cons to each and I will read up on everything

How do people find out about ICOs? I hear people talking about up coming ICOS but how do people find them ? How‚Äôs do they get announced?

Is there a beginners guide to all this? As I have said I have been reading about this and trying to learn the lingo and speech as much as possible since maybe around New Year‚Äôs Eve (not long I know but you have to start somewhere!)

I have been looking for podcasts to learn a little more, I know it‚Äôs not a case of someone telling me, me buying Andy then me being a millionaire, I know there isn‚Äôt a risk and I‚Äôm not going to be using money I can‚Äôt afford to lose, and I know by 2019 I won‚Äôt be looking to travel the world on my altcoin currency funds.

I just noticed this post is basically me talking rubbish but honestly if you can give me any information, any tips or any advice no matter how small that helped you when you started or what you could go back and tell yourself I forgot you could?

There white paper can be founder [here](https://dadi.cloud/public/files/dadi.white-paper.pdf).  Also, note that this ICO is open to US citizens.

It looks like a pretty promising startup. Registration for the public sale is now available on their website. They'll be selling 50M coins at $0.50, which equates to a $30M market cap (including pre-sale). That puts it about 285 on market cap rank.

My idea would be to store offline wallets or keys on an external harddrive/encrypted file container using veracrypt (https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html) or something similar. Additionally an encrypted file container can be stored on multiple harddrives or even backed up in a cloud drive because no one can decrypt/access the container without a password. An encrypted folder looks like a useless file without veracrypt and the password to open it. (It is even possible to create hidden volumes)

To improve safety more I thought about using Tails Linux (https://tails.boum.org/) booting from a USB stick with a VPN to connect to the internet (if exchanges allow it).

Bonus points: The whole solution is based on free and open source software and can be used with high anonymity.

My first thought was to obviously put an importance for each currency.

For example, you believe in Dash Ripple Etherum Monero and Neo equally.

So you think their market cap will reach a the end the same % growing.

So i put 20% on my money in each of these currency.

Then I was thinking about distributing my gaining each day or each week so that each crypto has always 20% of my total cash.

Obviously, you can always change the importance you put in those coins and add new coins, reading news etc.

So in this case, the good thing is you always gain a bigger part of the coins that go down or stay at the same price, by distributing your gains of the ones that are growing up. Cause you believe the one that go down will eventually grow later.

Then I realised that when you have a big position in one of your five coins. For exemple Neo grows a lot. Then you will eventually make easier cash because of your position.

So in this second case, the best thing would be to not distribute your gainings of one coin to the other coins. Or just distribute a little. Cause you are thinking that a bigger position in one coin makes that a lower growing makes still cash.

Which management methods you think is better?

I need a wallet to store my coins, and I have heard almost unanimously from everyone out there that hardware wallets are the most secure. The most popular being Ledger Nano S.

What is the storage limit in Bitcoin that can be stored on the wallet? 10 Bitcoin? 100?


What currencies are supported on the wallet? Are there are any left out? I have a pretty diversifed portfolio which sucks because there are no wallets that can store all of my coins.


Are there any fees to store them? Some wallets require a fee to store, like for example a lot of wallets (all wallets?) require a deposit of 20 XRP in order to store any more. Does Ledger Nano S have any of this?

I am afraid, that for example, a coin will have its ATH and after that will just descend into the void because of (insert whatever, in Crypto everything seems possible).

The biggest reason why XRB rose so much so quickly is because of its small market cap at the time as well.

I am not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I figured it was better than nowhere (not enough karma for ethtrader or it's own post)

In early December I accidentally found a bug that let me withdraw ~6 ETH from Gemini in 2 withdrawals for about 3 ETH each.

However, only 1 of these withdrawals was taken out of my account.

I promptly emailed their team with steps to reproduce the bug, and sure enough they did an ""Administrative Debit"" and took the remaining 3 away from me.

I did own 6 ETH, so this sets my balance to a net of 0.

Are these transactions reliable? Should I do a small test transaction from coinbase to gdax before moving the cash?

I am a first year college student looking for ways to pay off loans fast, and I think cryptocurrency may be my answer.



I got onboard the Bitcoin train in Late December (and I have seen essentially zero gains) and began to look into altcoins. I looked around and saw that Ripple, Stellar, and Verge all looked pretty promising so I bought about a dozen coins each.



I did some research and found out that I have to pay taxes on gains that I make from cryptocurrencies. And as someone who does not have the slightest clue how to do anything related to this, it worries me. I do not how to file taxes. What form to I file? How much do I pay? When do I file it? How do I file it? What happens if I can't figure out how?


I really really need serious help with this, because I'm worried that I won't figure it out and I'll end up in jail for tax evasion or something.

I really appreciate that so many of you have taken part. It is good for the crypto community to have some up-to-date data on crypto user demographics. Please take a few minutes to complete the survey, share the link perhaps to other media so that we can get at least 2000+ responses.

The more responses, the more accurate the survey.

Once we get 2000+ responses, I think we can start to draw some conclusions from the data, but ideally, the more the better.

Thanks for your time and contribution. Raw data will be made available once the survey is closed.

What's a good exchange or exchanges to use? Changly and Shapshift seem good for quick dealings and less identification (unlike CBase and others with SSN/addresses etc., needed and calls for verification), but allegedly have high fees? Can anyone speak to this/these?

What is evryone's thoughts on exchanges yet to launch like MNKEY and FAIR X? A potential CBase kyllr is the latter, with great arranges of currency swapping, but this user is wary of it being backed by I B M and possibly W F bank, and thusly, the gummit and tax collectors (AnCap here).

What is/are some good (hard and digital) wallets? Got one on the way already in the nano s (Trezr order got cancelled somehow but good news is nano s holds more different types of coins, ones this user wanted that aren't just the main ones), what are peoples' thoughts on Dadulus and Electrm and N E O wallet?

So many guys & gals running around accusing everyone of the acronym ""FUD"" because they can not construct a counter argument, present any facts nor discussion. Hell they can't even theorises. And due to their linguistic minimalism many cant even bang together more than one sentence at a time!
Sure there is blatant obvious FUD out their specially in the MSM. But any wanker can accuse someone of FUD - but can you back it up!
Anyway, start calling these people ‚ÄúFUD SNITCH JACKETS"" specially the ones who call & accuse everything & or everyone FUD or FUDER with no proof. Enjoy ;)

2. Take a percentage off to actively swing trade with and alternate between daily lows and highs (for example use 25% of your portfolio worth)

3. Directly follow latest information and sentiment and act accordingly. (Follow the reddit page, Twitter, website, sign up for alerts)

4. Take time to learn chart analysis, even if it is just the fundamentals. It will increase your ability to predict the market and hone your decision making.

This strategy mitigates risk by diversifying and locking in a strong foundation for trusted coins and increasing your holdings by transferring value between them.

I want to start investing in Altcoins - perhaps you could be so kind and answer a few questions for me.

So, if I got that right, one way would be to
* 1. Buy Bitcoin via Coinbase (using a small amount I can happily live without)
* 2. Transfer Bitcoin to Binance and build a portfolio
* 3. I want to spread my portfolio evenly with ENG, IOTA, ICX, REQ, OMG and XLM (is that too much? Should I focus on fewer altcoins?)

Okay, now I have a nice portfolio and wait. But what happens then? When the coins go up, do I re-convert that into Bitcoin and re-invest into other coins? But if I get that 

right, Bitcoin is like the Altcoin-Baseline? So, if my portfolio rises by 100% but the Bitcoin price rises by 100%, too then I won't have gained anything, right? I still can 

only buy the amount of Bitcoin I started with?! How can I turn my gains into actual profit then?

Ive been trying to work out some general sectors that Cryptos can be grouped into. you can see what ive done so far at http://cryptoinvestorsguide.com/sector-analysis/

Below are the broad sectors I think make a good start. What changes would you make? Im open to suggestion/ discussion.

BITCOIN BASED- Either forks of bitcoin or copies with differences.

SMART PLATFORM- Technological platform that can be built upon usually packed with smart features.

PRIVACY- Main purpose is to provide privacy for the user.

DECENTRALIZED APPS- Normally a platform in which main function is decentralized applications.

BANKING- Primarily for banking, transaction and micro-payment based cryptos.

EXCHANGE/MARKETPLACE- Coins whose function is to operate on a crypto exchange or digital marketplace

UTILITY- These coins have been created to perform a specific function or utility.

This exchange is backed by IBM and should come with lower fees than CoinBase. People seem pretty upset with coinbase (re: the BCH fiasco), so it isn't unreasonable to think this new exchange could steal a significant portion of their base.

XLM will be the key underlying coin on this exchange. This will be the first non BTC BCH ETH or LTC to hit a ""major"" exchange.

The culprit seems to be that Blockfolio is pricing Ripple at ¬£1.51  ($2.05) whereas CoinCap, CoinMarketApp and CryptoPro have it ¬£1.75 ($2.36).

Do Blockfolio their feeds from somewhere else? Am I going mad?

Its market cap is still not very high, it could go up quite a bit still. Maybe no mooning, but decent returns throughout the year. 

. SubStrantum (SUB): also a pretty good team behind it, could host services on the blockchain (very useful for countries with censorship like China and US after net neutrality fiasco). 

. Kyber Networks: also promising project.

IÔ∏è recently invested in HOQU. They give you like 5,750 of their tokens (IÔ∏è think HQU) in exchange for 1 eth. If this coin starts out as a lot of them do when they go public at less than a cent, then IÔ∏è have lost a lot of money, right? Even if they are at $0.01 or $0.05 upon release to the public IÔ∏è still have lost money. $800 could buy me 80,000 of them at one cent instead of the 5,570 that they give.

Here is a hypothetical scenario:

This is were the term shilling can be brought into question. Is it shilling when another person is trying help another person? Is that not we are doing here, to help one another?
I certainly think so.
So with that being said, rather than looking at a post as being 'shilly' look at it in a new light with an open mind and do your own research.
And if it feels like everyone is talking about one individual piece of tech, there's probably a good reason for it.

That's why we're backing the only non-commercial LN implementation.

Also IOTA and Raiblocks are not any more scalable than VTC. To make VTC the same thing in terms of technical structure as IOTA/Raiblocks you would simply have to reduce the block size to one transaction per block and make every block valid require only the minimum difficulty. Then, users are expected to mine their own transactions (a block with one tx in it) into the chain. This is how they claim to have ""no fees"", since there is no explicit fee to pay. However, the chain space is still limited by network latency etc so once that space becomes full, pe""ople will just have to wait a long time for confirmations as their txs are constantly reorged out of the chain. Thus there is an implicit fee of having to wait an undetermined amount of time once the chain is congested (or pay someone else to wait for you)""

9110,"Please help me understand the inverse relationship between BTC (or any coin that can be purchased with fiat) and alt coins. 
The way I see it would be if BTC goes up, its going up because the market cap is increasing at a rate faster than the supply. So simple supply and demand. Either people are buying btc with their fiat currency (increasing the cumulative market supply for all crypto) or selling their alts for BTC (increasing the BTC market cap but not the overall crypto market) 
    Alt coins are usually their price to purchase one coin against btc. Lets say in an unrealistic world, the market cap for a coin stays the same for a day. So if there is an increase in BTC price, the cost to purchase that coin using BTC would decrease. But the overall fiat value of that coin wouldn't be affected, just how much BTC it costs to purchase that coin. That would be in the case of people using their fiat currency to buy more crypto.
The fiat value of an alt would only decline if people are moving their alts into BTC thus increasing the market cap of BTC while simultaneously decreasing the market cap of that alt coin.
Or am I not understanding correctly?

9369,"Just bought Hedge Token (HDG) after seeing a post on here about it the other day, which I think is a gem. Was voted Crusher of the Month by CrushCrypto.

It basically aims to be an exchange traded fund (something like S&P 500 index) for crypto. The Hedge Project creates crypto traded indices (CTIs) that anyone can invest in. It is different from other crypto investment platforms in that their CTIs are passively managed, following a set of rules and guidelines similar to how index funds work in the traditional finance space. Hedge Project is a platform where they design the index for others to invest and collect the management fees. They don‚Äôt put any capital at risk and as such, the project is a lot more scalable than other crypto funds. HDG tokens are used to pay for fees incurred on the Hedge Project platform. If users have HDG in a trading account, they will pay fees automatically with the tokens. If they don‚Äôt, there will be a function that will buy the tokens in the spot market with a market order. 20% of the profits generated from the Hedge platform will be used to buy back and burn HDG tokens. Therefore, HDG token supply will be deflationary. They have a talented project team with members coming from Deloitte.

They've already got a working product (three index classes) and it's sitting at a $17M market cap while it's just had a good pullback, so there's lots of potential for upside.",0.8442,daily_general_discussion_january_2_2018,0.026,0.919,0.055

I do believe in these coins but also expect bitcoin to pump back to 20-25k in the near future. If that happens, I expect the alts would take a hit. Tough decision whether to either sell high on alts/buy low on bitcoin or continuing to go with what has been working for the past few weeks. Any thoughts?

PS - I only started investing in alts 2 or 3 weeks ago, other than LTC and ETH. Not sure I can expect this alt run to last.

I experienced problems when i wanted to create an account on different crypto websites. They either dont accept new customers or the verification process takes weeks (which i think is pretty long in this topic). I found a way to create an account on anycoindiret, although they dont accept new customers! You have to go to the main website and scroll down. There you will find a box with: ""Trade 100‚Ç¨ without verification"". When you click on this banner, you can still create a new account. It seems the forgot to disable this way to create a new account. It worked for me (I'm from germany).

9401,"I have 2 questions about cryptocurrency.

What‚Äôs the actual value behind crypto?  
The coins only have value because everybody thinks they have value. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything tangible backing it. You can argue this works the same way as the ‚Äúfull faith and credit‚Äù propping up real money. The difference is real money used to be backed with gold, silver, etc for most of history and it took hundreds of years for it to be worth something just because we said it was. Coins are only valuable because they can be exchanged for real money.

How do I know the coins, wallets, exchanges are real?

Good that you believe in new projects and you should but only having those is so risky.

**2018s Biggest Losers:**  
I recommend getting out of all Gen 1 blockchains. BTC/BCH/LTC/VTC/GRS etc. The reason is that these coins can only succeed on a large scale with a technological leap that seems very precarious right now (i.e. lightning network). From the existing issues and delays, and even the cons that would exist if the technology *does* work, I consider these coins to be out competed by XRB and other emergent coins which will scale more effectively with Gen 2 tech.

Sorry I have not been posting much lately. Been busy with the holidays!  I hope you all had a happy new year.

Pretty much all of my sell orders went through this past week, so I had to find a new set of investments.  After spending a few days researching various news, upcoming events, and  my own chart / trend analysis I bought into the following coins.  I believe each one will hit the SAT price next to it, or higher, between now and mid Feb.  

TRUST ‚Äì 4800

GLD ‚Äì 4900

CLAM ‚Äì 320k +

GAME ‚Äì 100k +

SEQ ‚Äì 10k

VTC ‚Äì 120k+

BRK ‚Äì 7800

PKB ‚Äì 38k+

FAIR ‚Äì 14.5k

SLR ‚Äì 10k+

PAY ‚Äì 100k+

AEON ‚Äì 72k+

EGC ‚Äì 6800 +

IOP ‚Äì 110k +

POT- 7000+

FUN ‚Äì 1500+

As always, this is my own investment strategy, and it comes with just as much risk as any other.  Some are shitcoins that are due for a pump, and others are sound investments based on events that are happening this month.  I leave it to you to figure out which is which.

I would really like feedback because it has about a tenth of the market cap of its most similar competitor Verge. I attribute that to its lack of marketing, Reddit followers, etc. Otherwise, it seems the same but more promising. Am I missing something? Or do people agree with me?

These coins are on pretty shit exchanges and have really low volume so you may have to pay what seems like less than ideal prices for them, but I'm pretty confident that once these hit bigger exchanges they'll blow up.

1. Get about 5-10 different cryptos that you believe in and evenly distribute cash into all of them. 

2. Take a percentage off to actively swing trade with and alternate between daily lows and highs (for example use 25% of your portfolio worth)

3. Directly follow latest information and sentiment and act accordingly. (Follow the reddit page, Twitter, website, sign up for alerts)

4. Take time to learn chart analysis, even if it is just the fundamentals. It will increase your ability to predict the market and hone your decision making.

This strategy mitigates risk by diversifying and locking in a strong foundation for trusted coins and increasing your holdings by transferring value between them. 

DO YOUR RESEARCH. 

If you truly believe in Blockchain then you are in it for the long game. Making $10,000 is cool and paying off your credit cards is great but if you cash out it is really hard to go back into Iota for $50 a pop when you bought it for 42 cents in November 2017.

10208,"Howdy!

I know there's a ton of coins out there, and you all have your reasons for investing in the tokens and coins of your choice. I did want to raise some awareness about Loopring (LRC) though! I'm posting this for two main reasons: 

1.) To populate r/loopringorg

2.) To get a little more discussion about the tech and its competitors

So, [what is Loopring?](https://loopring.org/en/index.html) Loopring ""is not only a protocol but also a decentralized automated execution system that trades across the crypto-token exchanges, shielding users from counterparty risk and reducing the cost of trading."" The protocol seeks to pool the liquidity of cryptocurrency's. It is an *agnostic protocol* that can be operated on any program that operates Smart Contracts. LRC's vision is to run their protocol on the Top 10 Smart Contract platforms, so as not to ""put it all their eggs in one basket."" 

Loopring is headed by Daniel Wang, who in prior professional lives was involved with Google, co-founder of various other start-ups, and has experience as a senior director and blockchain researcher at Zhongan Technology. To boot, Daniel Wang is friends with Hongfei Da (founder of NEO), who was an early investor in LRC. 

Loopring offers benefits to both users and exchanges by: 

* deferring risk from both parties in decentralized smart contracts, 

* minimizing fees and cost to create more profitable orders through ring-matching and order-sharing, and 

* as a cross-platform protocol. 

Additionally, the Dev team released their [2018 Road Map](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-2018-rnd-roadmap-33b423526669), which contains realistic goals for the year. I'd really like to point out one tidbit of information:

* ""For both NEO and Qtum, we are fairly certain that the majority of LRN/LRQ will be distributed to, Ethereum based, LRC token holders based on a snapshot of each addresses LRC balance at certain block height, in the future.""

Yes, you read that right. **For each LRC you buy and hodl**, within some time in Q1 and Q2 **you'll receive an equivalent amount of LRx tokens for Qtum and NEO.** 

[Blockchain Brad had a really good interview with Daniel, that helped share his vision and talent.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA5zgPvDdjE) 

I hope this came off as educational, and not too shill-ish. Obviously, I'd like to see this community grow, but also, this is an opportunity for investors to get into LRC early and receive benefits of getting LRx tokens for simply hodling.

Top 10 best performing Cryptocurrency 2017:
01) Ripple
02) NEM
03) Ardor
04) Stellar
05) Dash
06) Ethereum
07) Golem
08) Binance coin
09) Litecoin
10) OmiseGo
...
14) Bitcoin

Honestly, I'm quite surprised that Ardor has made it even in the top 10. There was almost no media coverage on this project last year.
Looking forward to 2018 :)

Posted the link above also earlier in the Ardor community:

Later realised the whole list would be interesting to place in the Cryptocurrency sub Reddit. Too few karma to make an actual post here, so now part of this daily thread.

10382,"For anyone wondering why there seems to be an UNGODLY amount of shilling for coins like BNTY, DBC, and UFR, just know that 4chan.org/biz/ as well as some PnD discord groups are behind it. There are plenty of threads on /biz/ discussing ways in which they can pump specific low-cap coins and then hand off their bags to the ""plebbit normies"" (us). Hence why a shitty video about DBC got 110 upvotes in about five minutes. They're using this subreddit as a free advertising space, and a lot of you new folks are falling for it. Don't. DBC is a bad idea‚Äîdistributed AI processing is surprisingly inefficient and the company has faked ties to a lot of companies. If you look at the sell walls, the ICO holders are making a killing off dropping millions of coins onto hopeful 100x'ers. BNTY is a fine idea but it certainly doesn't deserve to 100x nor does it deserve the uncanny amount of praise it's getting on here, like, six posts or so an hour under ""new"". Every time that coin spikes, another person who got screwed by the last dump hands their bag off to the next unsuspecting victim. It's a chain of loss, from one person to the next. UFR proposes to be Piratebay... except no one wants to PAY for piratebay. In fact, that brings about more issues of privacy and legality. 

My point is: do your research. Do NOT post in this thread asking for which new low-cost coin is going to moon. Yeah, maybe you could have done that a month ago and genuinely discovered something cool like Neo or Req or XRB, etc., but now this community has been infiltrated. People know that this is where people come when they want to find out more about crypto. Gullibility and earnestness is being turned over for profit and the people who have been in the game for a long time are just making more and more while all the newcomers keep getting screwed on new coins with promises that they will moon. Do your own research, or at least ask for advice from people you know in real life‚Äîpeople who cannot or will not profit off screwing you over. 

It's getting crazy in this market. Protect yourselves and your money. Invest in products you believe in; those are the ones that will survive if ever a crash is to come, not the low market-cap easy moons. 90% of these coins will fail eventually. Find the good ones. Don't let someone tell you what's gold when you have eyes. ",0.946,daily_general_discussion_december_31_2017,0.089,0.782,0.129

I managed to dump it all into XRB and increased my investment by 40ish percent.  I am considering dropping the rest of my bitcoin from my portfolio and buying more XRB. The future of BTC doesn‚Äôt look promising to me. There are too many issues that stop it from being a very fast or reliable means of completing transactions. However XRB seems to solve a lot of these issues.

Now this is where my FOMO comes in... which I know it shouldn‚Äôt. XRB has jumped to 20$ recently, and with what looks like binance adding it in the future. I predict a skyrocket. BTC on the other hand is stagnant. However I don‚Äôt want to miss out if anything happens with bitcoin.. I know... stupid mentality but still lol.

My next natural thought is this though: there is a nuclear arms race (of a sort) going on right now to see who can develop the fastest currency. That's great. But I suppose what I'm getting at is......today, it's RaiBlocks. Last year it was Ethereum/Litecoin (of the mainstream coins). Next year its.....MichaelJohnsonCoin and after that UsainBoltCoin right. The next iteration of cryptocoins are gonna be speedy as hell (and that's great for the users) but the next purely transactional crypto that will achieve real mainstream adoption (a la Bitcoin) has to be Power-grid friendly while being widely used/adopted IMO. It can't use the same TWh as [actual relevant OECD nations](https://steemit-production-imageproxy-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/DQmNi9rCLjHA4SYjHTUFSe2Lzc9vm8gsj2HmSjHWffy2VPG). For all I know RaiBlocks achieves this (still researching the coin, I apologize if it does) but IMO that's what the next great transactional coin will look like.

10545,"Just wanted to share another, ""don't do what I just did"" post regarding XRB. 

Ahhhhh Bitgrail. I was hoping to turn some of my walleted XRB profits to REQ earlier today as my holdings of the latter are kind of slim and I like the way it's headed. Anyway, they have a minimum deposit of 100 mrai, which unbeknownst to me at the time, means straight up 100 RaiBlocks. Anything sent under that threshold is lost - just gone - presumably pocketed by BitGrail. I transferred 4 XRB over thinking mrai must be some small decimal point of a RaiBlock, I'm safe. Nope, should have done the research. 4 isn't a lot, I know, but it's gone. Luckily, I got in XRB pretty early that the (at time of typing) $80 USD I just threw away doesn't hurt too bad, but....damn.

10572,"I've been watching Offchain with Jimmy Song and Tone Vays now for about a month or so, and one thing that has become clearly apparent is that these two guys, although very knowledgeable with Bitcoin (especially Jimmy) label everything that is NOT Bitcoin a scam coin.

It doesn't matter what the cryptocurrency, it doesn't matter the potential application, the developement team, or the new innovative tech like sharding for instance.....according to these two ass clowns; they are all scam coins or shit coins.

Ethereum? Yup..scam. Litecoin? Yup...scam. Bitcoin Cash? Oh absolutely scam coin even though it was Bitcoin before Segwit...oooh, they love to hate on Bitcoin Cash, especially Tone. I think it gives him a boner to hate on Bitcoin Cash and Roger Ver.

Now that Ripple is blowing up, the obvious conclusion by Tone is that it's obviously a scammy shit coin, with no use whatsoever. No use!
These guys are turning into a joke. When they aren't extolling the virtues of Blockstreams Bitcoin and how Lightning will solve everything, they are busy hating on every other cryptocurrency blockchain out there.

They remind me of the investment banks like JP Morgan who label Bitcoin as a scam, because Jimmy and Tone have turned into two crypto hating ass-hats.

I secretly wonder if they are on Blockstreams payroll because that would be the only thing that makes sense to explain their hate for anything other than Bitcoin, the Bitcoin with so many flaws and problems thanks to Blockstream, who incidentally is the company with all the solutions. But you'll never hear Jimmy and Tone admit that Blockstream infiltrated the development team of Bitcoin Core and sabotaged it, nor will you ever hear them admit that simply increasing block size like Satoshi wanted would solve all the problems.....why? Because they're paid by Blockstream (probably), that or they are Bitcoin Core zealots.

A recent example is Ripple.  It's the antithesis of that vision of circumventing middlemen and big banks.  If you made money from it, congrats, but don't accuse those of us who criticize it for helping the banks of FUD for pointing out that it's in conflict with the crypto ethos.  And don't insult the philosophical crypto users since the only reason you're able to make money from cryptocurrencies in the first place is because of the ideological visionary who created the first blockchain.

I would say that Hal Finney is rolling in his grave, but I suspect those I'm referring to don't know who that is.

By doing so they are forcing users away from the bank and have created a demand for better more usable blockchain technology for spending crypto. Which is good for crypto.

11200,"I have some queries related to taxation around crypto in US.

I use Binance for all my trades. Whenever I have done my due diligence on some Alt, I buy some ETH/LTC and send it over to binance and buy the Alt coin as desired. Now there are following transactions involved:

1. Buying ETH for FIAT from coinbase.
2. Moving bought ETH to Binance.
3. At Binance, buy the Alt with ETH moved.
4. Either hold the Alt at binance or move to the desired wallet.
5. Once you are ready to sell the Alt coin, you move it to any exchange, sell it for ETH and move it back to any place where you can convert it to FIAT.

For sake of numbers, suppose you bought ETH for $100 and moved it to Binance. Now, as per my understanding, step 1 and 2 won't cause any tax implication in US as this was just a transfer and assuming prices won't fluctuate that hard that your ETH moved from $100 to $110 in that moment. Step 3 is where the fun starts. If I instantly buy the Alt, the $100 won't have fluctuated much and I now have Alts with $100 price and this has caused me to create no case for taxes. Now after sometime, I plan to cash out the money and the Alt has reached to $150. I convert it to buy ETH and move it to coinbase and cash it out. This 50$ is the money over which I have to pay taxes on. Did I miss something out?

Scenario 2: I sell Alt for $150 but buy another coin for those $150 which after sometime rises to $250. Now, the taxes can be divided for two differences. 150-100 and 250-150. So tax would be on total sum of (150-100) + (250-150) = $150.

Scenario 3: You first Alt raised to $150 and you use this some to buy another sum and your total amount drops to $125 and now you want to cash it out. The taxable income in this case would be (150-100) + (125-150) = 25.

One little caveat, The initial assumption that the price doesn't fluctuate till the point I bought the Alt is almost impossible so I would say that it might have moved to $105 till I bought the Alt(To be on a safe side). Or could check on binance about the value of ETH before buying to be sure about it and use that amount in taxation purpose too. In that case, scenario 1 would be: (105-100)+(150-105) = 50. Rest of the scenarios follow as above.

It isnt the ""no product"" company that people *love* to spread misinformation about on this sub because they missed out on gains or take what a stranger said online as mantra.

Its a high level project and is very technical but *worth* the time investment.

There is a reason this has grown so quick after such a short amount of time. It is not a pump as some people who spread FUD would have you believe.

When you dig deeper and see what is being designed here you understand *why* there is so much dollars being thrown into this project in the short time its been on the market and why it continues to power on despite whole sector corrections.

(Even though this project actually started 2 years ago)

They are innovating here - which is what most other blockchain organizations aren't doing in this space, many would rather ride on hype alone and build *another* privacy coin or store of value coin.

[They are even exploring a blockchain gps system that doesnt require satellites] (http://www.zyen.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1748&Itemid=359) which can be built on the Cardano blockchain itself.

The money entering them is smart money who are thinking long term and understand exactly what is getting designed and its implications from a technological standpoint and eventual enteprise adoption.

There is a reason this project is being built by Scientists and Phd's! Its because they are the ones most equipped to push this technology forward. This is the next needed step in blockchain technologies dapps and daos and could potentially see the rise of whole new digital value industries and value data transmission.

That blockchain gps solution *alone* is a multi billion dollar industry in itself and when you factor in things like the quantum resistance, common programming language support, scaleability that *increases* with users, you start realizing how valuable their platform is.

This is far undervalued for the team and the sheer scope and before those write to me saying ""well its unproven"" or driven on speculation I hope you realize that ***ALL*** of crypto is driven on speculation. 

Multi-billion dollar market caps for everyone? Come on guys.

Atleast this team is building something to try and justfiy the ludicrous valuations we have in this space than copying whatever  alt coin variation is flavour of the month.

2) XLM - partnered with IBM and founded by an ex-co founder of Ripple. Supposed to be faster, seamless, and better overall compared to other coin that's already mature in the market.

3) XRP - centralized version of crypto which has an alternative view to most cryptos in that it strives to partner with banks rather than go against them (which technically goes against the basic foundation of cryptocurrency).



It's probably doubtful all 3 of these become complete success stories because of the variation in each one's goals in the industry but feel like there's promise overall.

Xrp is changing the way financial institutions work by making then ubderstand the benefits of blockchain and crypto currencies. Yes they are not decentralized like the others but they don‚Äôt need to be because they are trying to make a heavily centralized (banks) a better tool for the masses.

By lower fees and settlement times, the cost for transferring money and time it takes will change drastically. Instead of picking up pitcforks against the evil bankers it is much more productive to show them the benefits of these new techs.

When you want to change something as big as the financial industry you don‚Äôt kick it out with a new tech, you let it accept it slowly. I believe eventually banks will become much mire transparent using ledgering systems and fees will become much less. Xrp is doing it right. 

You can hate it all you want saying you dont support banks but when you fund your cryptos you are wiring money to and from your bank. We need banks and we need banks to be better.

Everyone says this, but fantastic devs. Includes the developers of btcsuite, & also the author of the atomic swap code used recently by BTC and LTC.

Unique hybrid PoS/PoW system that is extremely resilient to attacks. Making a 51% attack extremely difficult & a minority hard fork nearly impossible for example.

Direct PoS worth 20%+ per year. No masternodes or DPoS where you will inevitably run into issues like the ""Lisk elite""

The project is relatively young, at almost 2 years since launch. So it's still getting in early.

Great, active community, that is distributed pretty evenly around the world.

Big war chest in the community treasury (something like $30-40 million currently).

Support from many influential community members including Charlie Lee & Jimmy Song.

At least 2 competing ASICs coming out next year... should be an indicator of where some see this project going.

The project? DCR. Decred. Decentralized Credits. In the future, people don't use coins, they use *credits*.

""***If you want to make stupid sums of money quickly in crypto, start thinking stupidly, and quickly.***

That is how these markets are working right now.  Pure herd mentality, right off of a cliff probably / eventually.  Figure out what will attract the stupidest investors and then pile in and pump the hell out of it.  In case you don't know what these factors are, they include (but are not limited to): low nominal token price, possible exchange listings, (often specious) corporate partnerships, celebrity endorsements, etc.

It is all a bit reminiscent of the ERC-20 mania during the summer.  And definitely of penny stocks.

Shitty projects with limited fundamentals are posting gains that defy logic, while solid projects languish for a while.  This condition is not permanent, and will be ameliorated as more professional and smart money enters the space...or as the stupid money grows tired, eventually loses most of it, and exits crypto- only to buy back in solely into ETH or BTC several months later because they are tired of getting ""burned.""

Will that happen in 3 months, 1 year, or 2 years?  I don't know, but it will happen.  This is the way of any emerging market / asset class.

*Personally, I'm here to invest for the long term, so I could care less what the token of the week is.  My sanity, and ability to sleep at night, are more important to me than trying to chase a quick buck.*""

When you're buying ""Ripple"", you don't own anything, XRP is merely a token in a centralized system that you are only RENTING!!!

- THEY (the banks) don't even have to use this token!!!!!

- THEY (the company ripple) own the vast majority of those tokens and have ultimate control over it so they can manipulate the market as they please.

- THEY can close shop or drop the token like a hot potato and make a new one at any give time.

- You are NOT buying shares and you are NOT buying a real currency.

You can argue that this serves a specific purpose yes, but only ONE purpose, you won't be able to buy coffee with this, you won't be able to buy a Lambo, this is just a TOOL to send money for banks (NOT FOR CASUAL USERS - this was said by the company itself!!!!!). This isn't a store of value by any means, the banks get in and get out in seconds just to fulfill their transfer.

11827,"Hello All,

After a tumultuous first few weeks in the crypto world I feel I may have over-diversified.

I am curious to hear opinions on how I could best consolidate my portfolio (or if I should).

TRX - Tron - 10% - The only reason Tron is so high is because of the gains.

NEO - NEO - 9%

REQ - Request 8.6%

ETH - Ethereum - 8.2%

WTC - Walton - 7.75%

IOT - Mega IOTA Token - 7.5%

OMG - Omisego - 7.3%

ADA - Cardano - 7% The only reason ADA is so high is because of the gains.

ICX - Icon - 6.8% The only reason ICX is so high is because of the gains.

BTC - Bitcoin - 4.7%

ENJ - Enjin - 4.5%

MOD - Modum - 4.5%

SUB - Substratum - 4.3%

XLM - Stellarlumens - 4.2%

LTC - Litecoin - 2.72%

BNB - Binancecoin - 2.67%

XRP - Ripple - 0.2% (Dust from before I was aware of the wonders of BNB)

Note these percentages are approximate and so they may not sum to 100%. There is not a large amount of money in this portfolio (<$500).

What do you think? I would like to ""set it and forget it"" as much as possible until at least spring 2018 as I think I enjoy trading and watching prices a little more than is good for me during school...

Do you think the diversification will capture the overall trend of the market well? So far I am doing alright (maybe 20% up overall), however I can't say I have bought any Lambos yet. Would you recommend consolidating into a smaller number of coins? If so, which coins? Anything you would recommend more/less of?

I don't have any specific goals - I enjoy researching the coins and watching the market and I am just doing this with money I can afford to lose.

Any opinions are welcome.

11842,"I came into the Crypto world in 2013 with Bitcoin and Litecoin being the big players. With these blockchain developments there were never ICOs and this of that nature. My question is, are there any coins that are using the traditional way to launch or has everything turned to ICOs? It would be nice to see more projects using the traditional launching method. Yes it might slow down hitting the charts number wise but I think it would building a stronger coin in the future (price and community wise), give developers and investors more time to commit to the project or not, and take a lot of speculation out of the market.

So is it just me or does the rise of ripple always seem to come with the fall of the other big crypto currencys. To me it seems like any banks holding the other cryptos seem to transfer them into Ripple to bolster it. I know Bitcoin was originally made to be away around banks and other institutions. So could this be the bank's trying to cause us to lose faith in the other coins and simulate a ""pop"" so we invest in their version of crypto? I'd love to hear what everyone thinks. I'm new to the crypto world so if anyone has any information either supporting this or disproving it I'd love to hear it!

11981,"I'm pretty sure some of you may have seen DeepBrain Chain appearing. It looks very interesting although I still need to go into the details of the whitepaper. I just wanted to post this for everyone to get an idea of what the market cap would be. Here are my calculations based on the white paper's  table:

Purpose | Proportion | Quantity |  Remarks 
----------|-------------|-----------|------------
Token Sale public offering | 9% | 0.9 bn DBC | Public Token Sale
DeepBrain Chain foundation and ecosystem | 25% | 2.5 bn DBC | Unlock 10% first month and unlock 10% remaining each year (total lock-period of 10 years)
Pre-Sale | 6% | 600 mn DBC | Private investors
DBC team | 10% | 1 bn DBC | Unlock 10% first month and unlock 10% remaining each year (total lock-period of 10 years)
Mining | 50% | 5 bn DBC | In the first 5 years of mining, 500 million DBC is produced each year, and the income is reduced every 5 years by half

Based on this the current market cap whereby we take the total of the public and pre-sale as well as the inital 10% for the ecosystem and 10% for the team leads to a total amount of 1,850,000,000 coins. With the current price of $0.077 this leads to a market cap of $143,312,100.00, which is roughly 118th on coinmarketcap.

Year 2 would involves a total circulation of 2,700,000 if we use the previous supply, add 20% (10% for ecosystem and 10% for the team) and then add 500,000,000 that would be mined which would result in a market cap of $209,158,200 based on today's price.

I hope this helps people make more informed decisions. I was initially deterred by the huge total supply, but with a market cap of $143mn it could be attractive.

12048,"Anyone looked into Zephyr (ZEPH - low market cap/price)? Bitsparks token for global remittence. Partnered with United Nations Dev for pilot program in Tajikistan launching in January 

&nbsp;

Curious to see what others opinions are. Just picked up a small amount and see it as a 2018 play that has a promising January and already associated with an established exchange/company, Bitshares.

>>In 2016, the total remittance industry was over $575 Billion. The main issue plaguing this industry is that Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), individuals that accept cash payments on behalf of senders, are having their bank accounts shut down due to banks de-risking. This leaves these individuals that are already without a bank account and little access to world currencies, unable to send money and left in the dark.

>>BitSpark has been in operation since 2014 and is regarded as the world‚Äôs first cash in, cash out blockchain remittance platform. BitSpark is now launching Project Zephyr (ZEPH) in order to eliminate banks from the remittance industry by allowing access to over 180 fiat pegged cryptocurrencies through their mobile app, Sendy and existing internet platform. BitSpark through the use of Zephyr aim to transform Money Transfer Operators (MTOs) into a worldwide decentralized cash in, cash out network.

>>This project has already been set into motion. In May, Project Zephyr in collaboration with the United Nations Development Program launched a pilot program for Tajikistan, a country with poor banking infrastructure and a large reliance on remittances that average 30% of its GDP. 25% of the service fee for each transaction on BitSpark‚Äôs network, will be used to buy back Zephyr tokens from the market and there are already 500,000 cash out locations in seven countries. This token combined with BitSpark‚Äôs network offers a lot of potential, even more so when you consider that it only has $7,000,000 market cap.

My best guess is that the volatility and continuous change in price is leading to a delay in the reported value of the TW.

Now everyone is falling to the Banks as again. Switching from Banking in the ""old world"" to ""centralized crypto Banking"" who wins? You (we) won't the Banks will win it again.

12649,"The Verge team releasing the Wraith protocol on the very last day of the year, just so that they can claim they released the Wraith protocol in 2017, is not a good sign.  As someone with experience in software developing, it is never a good sign when you have to release a software update right at the deadline, especially if there is no proof that your software is already working.

Verge is supposed to be an opensource project.  What is concerning is that up to this Wraith protocol release, I haven't seen any video or demonstration of the Wraith protocol in action.  Since the deadline is a few days away from Dec 31st, I would expect some type of video demonstrating Wraith is working.  At this point, for a typical software project, the Verge team should be testing and ironing out bugs but nevertheless, the Wraith protocol should be functional by now and there should be some video of the Wraith protocol in action.  In fact, if Wraith is functional, it would be in Verge's best interest to upload all the code to Github so that the community can spot potential bugs.

The fact that the Verge team hasn't given some type of demo or even mentioned the various milestones they have accomplished leading up to this Wraith release is a big red flag.  If the Verge team decides to release their Wraith protocol update for immediate public use, that's not good either because the public effectively becomes beta testers for Verge (would you want to transfer thousands of dollars worth of XVG, knowing you are ""beta testing"" for the Wraith protocol?).

12729,"So my uncle is adamant that there is a crucial flaw in having a global or nation wide economy based off of a crypto currency.  

Let me explain his concern. It is regarding loans. Specifically let‚Äôs consider mortgages. 

To make things simple, lets imagine that there was only 1000 USD cash in the economy, all owned by one person. This person goes to the bank and deposits all 1000 USD cash.  To make the math easy, let‚Äôs assume the federal reserve requires this bank to have 10% of this cash reserved. Now, a second person comes a long and wants a 900 dollar loan to buy a house (again ignore the unrealistic numbers).  Since 10% of the original deposit will still exist in the bank if they loan out this cash, they go ahead and loan out the 900 dollars cash to the second person.  Now we know there are only 1000 USD cash in existence. However, how much ‚Äúcash‚Äù or ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is owned between the two people? 1900 USD. This is the basic (really simple) explanation of the loan process.

Loans are crucial for our growing economy. Now, If we are no longer using USD, and our economy runs off of some XYZ coin,  How do loans work. Of course there would be ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù and such, where you have someone with a large quantity of XYZ coin, who would invest their capital in people/business and make a profit off of interest returned. This is exactly how investments happen now. But with out the loaning system I explained above (through something like a bank), I don‚Äôt see how people would get mortgages. No one is going to invest their personal capital in a house payment. Hence why we have banks and loans. Who would, and how could we ‚Äúloan out‚Äù 900 XYZ coins if their was only 1000 in existence and the first person has these coins in some wallet.

Now my knowledge in banking and economics is quite small, so correct me if anything is wrong in this post. I just want to spin up a conversation playing devils advocate. My question to everyone is could something like the loaning system we have with banks be technical possible in some crypto currency market? Or is this a non-issue all together? Thoughts?

I honestly feel like if more people understood IOTA and its ability this would be a no brain purchase.  Also, this is not a shill, at this point I own both IOTA and RaiBlocks.  I‚Äôm following them closely, RaiBlocks is having some growth because at this moment it‚Äôs being treated like a hype coin, whilst IOTA is seeing growth because of actual technology.  

I guess the big question is: will cryptocurrencies ever be judged on their ability and technology and not blindly purchased in ‚Äòdumb money‚Äô charts because the internet said so.  

Bubbles are created by uninformed investors doing spur purchases and subsequently, fear driven dumps.    I don‚Äôt personally fear a bubble, but a small bit of understanding can take your initial modest investment from a blind purchase, to a smart investment.

My though is, since the wallets are both generated in Bittrex,
shouldn't Bittrex be able to recover these.

Also are there any legit third party companies, that can perform
a misplaced coin recovery - originating from the Bittrex system?

That being said, their wallet app is being released in 3 days, and they do have a nice website with good marketing.

13174,"New to the game, amateur question. 
Point 1: We've seen in the past one month that a majority of the alts (XRB, XRP being the exceptions) are super dependent on BTC prices. Most of the alts crash when BTC does. 

Point 2: I read somewhere that even though the market cap in BTC has increased in the past year, the share of BTC in the crypto market has dropped down from 90% (start of the year) to 42% (yesterday). I'm assuming that this is a continuing trend and as more exchanges allow ETH trade pairs, it would eliminate the need to buy BTC for trading alts. Do you expect BTC dependence on alts will ease as ETH and LTC become more popular? 

Point 3: Wouldn't a rise in ETH vs. BTC be detrimental to most of the alts? At this point it seems like people aren't really interested in keeping BTC (for whatever reasons - tech challenges, scalability, expensive etc.). What is your takeaway looking at the market cap of ETH and BTC over the past year?

13185,"Hello All,

After a tumultuous first few weeks in the crypto world I feel I may have over-diversified. I tried to post this as a new post however I made a throw-away and so I don't have the requisite karma.

I am curious to hear opinions on how I could best consolidate my portfolio (or if I should).

TRX - Tron - 10% - The only reason Tron is so high is because of the gains.

NEO - NEO - 9%

REQ - Request 8.6%

ETH - Ethereum - 8.2%

WTC - Walton - 7.75%

IOT - Mega IOTA Token - 7.5%

OMG - Omisego - 7.3%

ADA - Cardano - 7% The only reason ADA is so high is because of the gains.

ICX - Icon - 6.8% The only reason ICX is so high is because of the gains.

BTC - Bitcoin - 4.7%

ENJ - Enjin - 4.5%

MOD - Modum - 4.5%

SUB - Substratum - 4.3%

XLM - Stellarlumens - 4.2%

LTC - Litecoin - 2.72%

BNB - Binancecoin - 2.67%

XRP - Ripple - 0.2% (Dust from before I was aware of the wonders of BNB)

Note these percentages are approximate and so they may not sum to 100%. There is not a large amount of money in this portfolio (<$500).

What do you think? I would like to ""set it and forget it"" as much as possible until at least spring 2018 as I think I enjoy trading and watching prices a little more than is good for me during school...

Do you think the diversification will capture the overall trend of the market well? So far I am doing alright (maybe 20% up overall), however I can't say I have bought any Lambos yet. Would you recommend consolidating into a smaller number of coins? If so, which coins? Anything you would recommend more/less of?

I don't have any specific goals - I enjoy researching the coins and watching the market and I am just doing this with money I can afford to lose.

Any opinions are welcome.

Thanks,

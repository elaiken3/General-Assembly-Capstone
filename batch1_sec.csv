I've never once complained about Asians selling, but I'm just curious, how is it racist? It's not a negative trait that someone is ascribing to Asians based on their nature, it's just an observation based on the correlation between start of day in Asia (where most crypto trading happens) and sharp drops in the market. (If any such correlation even exists. I'm not supporting the statement, just explaining how I understood other people's complaints.

Using an exchange tho there's gonna be buy and sell orders and you might lose a bit on bad trades. For example if you want to sell 1000 XRB for 0.1 XRB/BTC, and there is a buy order for 100 XRB for 0.1 XRB/BTC, and then another for 500 XRB at 0.097 XRB/BTC, so on, as you sell your whale load on that market you crash the price. You end up getting out somewhat worse than what you wanted. If you're holding a long time you might be a whale one day and this is something you need to consider. That's where cost averaging by selling in small chunks helps. Crash the price just slightly one day, let it recover, crash it slightly again the next day, and so on.

851,"nah, single issue voting isn't good. I agree with her politically on a lot of other things.

And she came off harsh, but she is worried about the outcome of allowing mass investment in crypto with how voilatile it is. It's easy to say ""Well you should know the risks before investing"" but a lot of people believe the government should try to protect people from hurting themselves (thus they demand warning on tobacco and alcohol for example or enforce speed limits).

It's NOT a bad thing we have speed limits, right? We DO want some basic rules to be enforced to protect people from hurting themselves and each other.

She was alluding to how the SEC has not done a good job of protecting investors from bogus investments and leading to a lot of people losing their retirements and such, and she knows crypto would be even worse

So again, yea you get what you get if you invest, but if the outcome of regulating crypto investments means mainstream grandmas and grandpas start losing their retirements because of bad investments that go volatile QUICK, we're not going to be in a good place.

To be clear, her attitude was because she's already gone at him before for not doing what she feels he should to protect people from bogus investments so the idea of allowing the SEC to regulate crypto when she doesn't feel they can get things right with current investment options is frustrating

Get in when you feel your getting value. When I first tried to get into WTC the best ratio was 31 WTC per 1-ETH, once it went to 41 WTC i was happy with value I got and got in. Good luck",0.9909,daily_general_discussion_february_6_2018,0.0,0.717,0.283

You should think in term of monthly income. A lump sum doesn't mean much IMO. Try to put all your dreams into monthly payment (ie a house is not 1 million, it's 5k/mo, a car is not 100k it's 1k/mo, etc.).  

On a side note, many studies have been made about that and it seems that, on average, your happiness won't increase after roughly 7.5k$/mo income. It varies between individuals (and location) but for someone living in the western world, that's about it. Everything after that increase comfort but not happiness.

1218,"Mr. Crapo:

Many bla bla, starts of with Hacks of exchanges and stuff then further positive bla bla. More regulation bla bla. 

Mr. Reed (epic voice):

Starts with positve sentiment towards crypto, bla bla.  The mentions hackers as well, investor protection. Admits he doesn't understand it. dotcom-bubble. blubb. Comes back to regulation, should not forget day to day jobs. Main-Street, Wall-Street bla. 

Most importantly he testifies that we should go after the bad guys abusing this market (important message).

Hon. Jay Clayton:

Bla bla.  Distributed Ledger technology will bring greate efficency to our capital market ... including more oversight to the market ... skips skips ... third point IPOs / ICOs are like stock offering. Jumps back to regular currencies. From what I see ICOs are like stock offerings / blubb. Lost the line here. You can call it a coin but if it functions as a security it is a security.

Buying an ICO does not mean you are investing in blockchain related ventures. Two are worth attention: If you are trading virtual currency on an exchange that looks like stock exchanges bear fearfull bla bla (we need more regulations for that basically). 

We do not have power over the market. bla bla. Can't regulate it all, tries to spread some fear. bla. They are looking to regulate it further anyway together with other agencies to enforce those laws bla. bla bla.

Hon J. Christopher Giancarlo:

Has kids, one of them working in a video game market - all of them talking about Bitcoin. Older cousins also owns Bitcoin. Mentions many of these guys present here have families that also own them. The should do a balanced decision, yet need to crackdown hard on abusers! (good message).

Several elements: First learn everything they can to engage with these innovators, next put things in perspective - the point is that Bitcoins market cap is less then the market cap of Mc Donalds. Brings up gold bla. The next task is to tell the public what we learn and regulators must help the public ... we never conducted so much research for any other market ... and the next element to excercise our legal element. The CNC doesn't regulate the virtual currency exchanges (as far as I understood). 

We do have enforcmentpower over spottrading - and will watch bitcoin future trading very closely and enforce the law. We have launched many legals actions against fraudsters regarding those (pretty good message!).

(On the bottomline pretty positive sentiment from him in my opinion)

Mr Crapo back:

Admits his children are into Bitcoin and Crypto as well. Asks if the congress adress revising our financial law so that one agency should have complete jurisdistriction over cryptocurrencies instead of needing several authorities.

Hon. Jy Clayton:

We should all come together and have a coordinated plan. Bla. Bottomline - virtual exchanges should be regulated like stock exchanges in the US.

Hon J. Christopher:

I agree with that. bla. Spot market. Survilance for fraudent manipulation. We need more power to close that gap of regulation (talking about US Exchange manipulation probably e.g. GDAX Bitcoin course or blatant media manipulation). So there's a patchwork here, that should be changed. (my own words as a summary).

Mr Crapo:

What are the appropiate rules ?

Hon. Jay clayton:

Admits its probably turning in a main market and should not use this patch work they are currently using

Hon J Christopher:

Markets have become global, not just cryptocurrencies. We should take that as a challange to all of us that should require a lot of new thinking. Bla (own summary again)

Mr. Crapo:

... muble muble should evaluate together ...

Mr. Reed (epic voice):

Investor protection is important. Talking about ICOs again ... mumble mumble. Restates the cooperation of all institutes with each others to chase after fraudsters. 

Hon Ya clayton:

Enforcement of securities (=ICOs)

Mr. Reed (epic voice):

Holding Wallstreet accountable for ... ???? ... (can someone explain?)

Hon. Jay Clayton:

?????

Mr. Reed (epic voice):

Troubled by SCC ... worried about enforcement on the Wallstreet and in addition to that Cryptocurrency and other ermerging markets.

Hon. Jay Clayton:

Admits they are lacking that, they are hiring (lol).

Mr. Reed (epic voice):

I hope the Budget is enough. 

Mr Shelby:

Asks for a Task-Force for Cryptocurrency.

Hon. Jay Clayton:

The funny thing they only work for their purpose when they are integrated in our financial system.

Hon. J. Christopher Giancarlo:

Formed a working group (no Task-Force). Basically watching, not aggressively but positively.

Hon. Jay Clayton:

Not yet, maybe later additional legislation about Virtual Currencies.

Mr Shelby:

(Disappointed) complains about the lack of liquidity and value. Bla bla. Has no further arguments.

Hon. J. Christopher Giancarlo:

The point the economists are making there is some kind of floor in the cost of Bitcoin (!!!)

Silence ...

Hon. Jay Clayton:

There are a lot of smart people saying that there are values in Cryptocurrencies (admits he is not)

Mr Shelby:

(Further disappointment) How do you put a value on Crypto?

[further bla bla important]

Mr Shelby:

(Gives up)

Mr Reed:

So whos responsible?

Hon. Jay Clayton:

Basically we formed a Cryptocurrency working group (NO enforcement force) to understand cryptocurrencies to get to understand them better.

Mr Reed:

(Asks where Cryptos are located - lol?)

But you need more people for that group yes?

Hon. Jay Clayton:

(smiling)

Hon. J. Christopher:

‚Ä¢There‚Äôs ramped up regulatory oversight and potential government crackdowns forcing many holders to exit positions. 

‚Ä¢Tax implications rearing it‚Äôs ugly head.

‚Ä¢The market has also been on a euphoric ride, with the run gaining too much momentum as latecomers look to get in on the action - a sure sign of a bubbling asset. 

‚Ä¢BTC transactions per second a major drawback, along with a mining community that has been less willing to process transactions due to the lower fees. 

‚Ä¢Massive downturn in sentiment as people on mass are getting seriously burned.

‚Ä¢Bitconnect left scars and new investors will be VERY weary of investing based on this clever scam and the huge sell offs that accompany the slightest bit of negativity

So when looking at the following FACTS: 

*High transaction fees, slow transfer times, lack of ability to truly innovate/scale once established (hence all the other Cryptos), inevitable regulation getting stricter and tighter, tax implications, exchange shenanigans occurring, bubble mentality which every man and his dog is now aware of, the hype is now well established and CLEARLY dissipating as fear sets in etc.*

Do you honestly think that the Pokemon Go style hype is going to come back and suddenly lift cryptos right back up to pre-crash levels anytime soon? Come on.

It's that simple.

Brigading may supposedly happen with ""90% of other coins"" (quoted as I have literally read on here multiple times since this recent ban) but the main difference here is that there is solid evidence to back up the recent transgressions of this one coin/part of their community. Bring evidence to light about other coins and their communities and they will probably get a time-out too. It really isn't that hard to understand. Is it necessarily fair? I don't know, tbh I don't care about this coin. But I am seriously tired of people whining about censorship when the main fact is, this coin/part of their community got caught/ousted for doing something bad and against sitewide rules, they are on time-out, go to their subreddit if you want to talk about it.

ETH:BTC has been roughly 10:1 lately. However, in some phases of january where the decline subsided it seemed like ETH was coming out stronger. That didn't last however and as BTC devalued further ETH dropped harder to catch back up to the 10:1 ratio.  
The other thing is that historically, when BTC rallies most alts (including ETH) aren't able to keep up or even bleed.  
The last thing to keep in mind if that for alt trading pairs, ETH is probably preferable. It's fast and cheap to transfer, goes with almost all coins and you can use it for the decentralised exchanges like IDEX and EtherDelta.",0.8847,daily_general_discussion_february_6_2018,0.009,0.899,0.091

It always comes back, and comes back higher than it was before. 

Also point out that the market isn't crashing for anything to do with the tecnology or the products. 

Blockchain technology is still revolutionary.  The projects are still moving forward full steam.  More large companies and big money are investing or developing their own projects. 

All of that should indicate that this crash is entirely emotional.  Fueled by investor panic and FUD.  It isn't permanent; it will rebound. 

The DOW corrected down 5%, its largest ever dip in a single day.  Ask them if they think that makes *stocks* bad now.  Are they a bad investment because they went down one day?

Very different than cryptos, which are intangible, do not produce anything (except price speculation), and have a short history of existence.

If the global stock markets collapse, then it won't matter if your stocks have gone to 0 because we'll be in anarchy fighting for food and water instead of ANY type of currency.

However, if cryptos crash to near 0...there wouldn't be much of a global pinch at all. Global economies would shrug it off as a ""good idea that wasn't ready for real implementation"".

We will see how long the bottoming out and growth takes anyway. 

To be honest, why we need this sideways movement is **for the Alts and ETH to recover** and not BTC. 

We need to decouple from it and get rid of the bad sentiments that have driven the market lately to start afresh. 

This may take a few months. 

But hopefully it will happen and ETH will take it's spot.

Do you think they're gonna come into the market at all time high prices? Of course not. They'll use the media to crash the market and stock up.

But under a worst case scenario for Tether, and 1 tether does not equal 1 dollar, you're not going to get your money back. You'd be lucky to get 30% of your money back. Ppl are going to do anything to convert tether to something else. One guy is certainly going to be willing to sell his tether for .99 to get his money, and the next guy is going to sell his for .98 to get his money ahead of that guy..and the next guy is going to sell for .97 to get ahead of that guy,  and this process is going to cause a cascading effect until its pretty much worthless.

Do these clients they have signed up even going to use XRP to transact? Does owning XRP even guarantee % ownership of the underlying company and its future prospects for profit?  Answer all these questions and you will see that it has no long term prospects in holding XRP. Can repeat these same questions for the majority of the crypto coins. Backed by nothing and clones of the same Bitcoin concept with a little extra added. Will there be uses for ETH sure, but break down where the value comes from. Its in the network, what causes people to keep running the decentralized network? What are the transaction costs? Is it sustainable?

5971,"A lot of cryptocurrency communities do this exact same thing. Here's how it happens:

- Discord groups post threads, telling people to ""go there and give it support"", or to ""upvote the thread""
- Subreddits link directly to threads on /r/cryptocurrency, along with people posting in the coin specific subreddits telling people to upvote

Any thread linked to a thread on /r/cryptocurrency is vote manipulation.

You can see it many times here if you're browsing /new - Threads with 30 upvotes that have been around 5 minutes. Threads that are new and fresh without substantial news that have TONS of upvotes.

If you look at all into these, look in the specific coin subreddit, linked discords, social media - I guarantee you'll find reddit thread links.

If you see these, use the report feature to send them to the moderators, and use [this reddit form](https://www.reddit.com/contact/) to contact Reddit Admins about it.

For a good example of Vote Manipulation, [here's a thread that was submitted the other day on /r/leagueoflegends](https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7v3si2/notoriously_toxic_340k_youtuber_ints_on_stream/) that was removed by Automoderator before anyone ever saw it.

As of now, this is one of the lower ETH (and most other coins) prices seen in the past 4 weeks. What you really want to avoid is buying any coin at its All Time High. So to answer your question, yes it is a good time to buy right now.

 very
 optimistic that developments in financial technology will help

enable us to better monitor transactions, holdings and obligations (including credit exposures)

including, importantly, investor protection.  
At the same time, regardless of the promise of this technology, those who invest their

deserve the full protections afforded under those laws.  This ever

6257,"Honestly, I think part of the problem for this market is that the ATH was built by PURE speculation, not based on a value proposition. Basically, if 80% of your investors don't know what the fuck bitcoin even is, they just want to get on the ""triple my money in a month"" bandwagon, you're going to get some crazy panic sells that build up momentum, then have trouble ever stopping.

Think of it this way, a bunch of with no knowledge of cryptocurrency look at the markets over the last few years and think ""fuck, this looks like a great investment"". Dump a bunch of money into it, and then watch to see what happens. Once the ""lets make some fast money bitches!"" people start to dry up, the number of people willing to buy for $20k quickly reaches zero. Now, as growth stagnates people who got in on the way up start to get nervous (realizing they don't know what they're invested in) and start to put in some sell orders to realize the profits they've taken. Then people who bought near the top think ""shit, now I'm losing money on an investment I know nothing about"" and they start selling off too, because they have NO IDEA where this shit is going.

Once it's in a downward trend, the selloffs will continue. It's one thing being patient when your profits have gone from 300% to 100%, but when you start dipping towards your buy in point, for a lot of people (again, who don't actually know the market) decide to say ""fuck it"" and pull the cord. Now you're stuck in a negative trending market, and the ""sell"" dominoes just keep on tipping over.

So, how does it stop? It stops when the asset become UNDERvalued for what it is, and people will jump in thinking ""what an awesome buy!"". The problem is, with so many of the investors in crypto not actually having any indication of what value it SHOULD be at, it's really hard to hit that point. 

So the answer is, no one really knows. I can tell you I think the bottom will fall out and it will go very low, stabilize, and have to build up a more useful use case first (so that the holders of bitcoin are 80% users as a currency rather than an investment). Someone else can tell you that it will never go lower than 7k, that you should be pumping all fiat into it RIGHT NOW, and that it will hit 100k by December. The truth is, as far as I am concerned, no one has a fucking clue.

6962,"You've said a few things along these lines.

A couple of people have pointed out that this isn't how the market cap works.

What they mean, is that to lower the market cap $450B you don't need $450B of selling. The market cap is only dependent on the most recent trade. 

There are ~ 17 million bitcoins. If bitcoin drops to $7000 dollars (i.e. there are no buys from $8000 down to $7000) then that wipes out $17 Billion in market cap. However, the amount of money removed is only dependent on the number of trades that happen on the way down.
 
For example, on bitfinex a market sell right now of 5824 Bitcoin for $43Million of bitcoin would drop the price to $7000 but wipe $17Billion in market cap. (Although this isn't likely to be how it happens in reality; order books are only part of the picture)

It was exactly the same on the way up. A market buy of 4138 bitcoin costing $37 Million would instantly set the price back to 10'000 and add $34B to the market cap.

This isn't quite how it works in reality - there are more exchanges, people tend not to market buy and sell large amount, and buys and sells influence people to enter or leave the market - but it just an illustration. It takes no where near $1B of dollars getting removes to move the market cap by $1B. Similarly, when the market cap was $500B, no where near $500B of dollars has ever entered the market.",-0.8176,daily_general_discussion_february_5_2018,0.045,0.95,0.004

6966,"I responded to you below but just to add it here as well:

The examples you just gave are completely different than Crypto.

The first one is an investment in yourself. The people I've seen that have had more than 300k in student loan debt are also making near that much or more annually so it is not an issue. If you took out that much and are making $50k, you made a bad decision.

Banks generally can recoup their loss on banks by foreclosing if necessary.

Major banks don't issue unsecured debt to new small businesses. Profitable existing, yes, but not new unknown.

It isn't one person taking out $500 in Crypto. It is thousands doing it, some doing chargebacks, some not being able to pay their credit cards. It is just easier for the bank to ban them.

The casino example gets thrown around here a lot. If an individual does too many cash advances at a Casino and has trouble repaying, the bank will shut down/free/lower their card limit also. The biggest difference is the Casino has you on camera taking out that cash so the bank is protected from a chargeback.

You're using anecdotal stories to attack a broad stroke the banks made to protect themselves and then calling it a conspiracy.",-0.7798,daily_general_discussion_february_5_2018,0.131,0.761,0.108

Repeat the cycle until you're broke? I guess we all have to learn the hard way ...

NEO and ETH are two of the safest bets out there, and both will soldier on despite what is happening in the market. With NEO, being able to generate GAS if the market does become relatively stagnant for mid-long term should look very appealing.

That said, no one should be stretching themselves too thinly.

7405,"Welcome to the crypto-market.

Let me give you a crash-course:

1. Realize if the drop is caused or leveraged by the coins being shitty themselves (bad news, exploits, hacks, developer getting killed and the like). Or if the fundamentals haven't changed.

2. Look at the Satoshi-Levels and judge accordinly (aka BTC) and not a the dollar values to see if they really dropped in value or if it's just related to BTC going down. Quite often the Satoshi level will increase even while BTC dips quite strongly, this can be an good indicator for a coin that will rebound more violently when it starts moving again.

3. Notice that the current crash is being caused by Bitcoin alone, pulling the whole market with it. Many people are anticipating it either going up again or it being flipped by Ether taking the 1st spot which won't happen without suffering pain.

4. I would not look at them achieving new ATHs soon or close to them. As such you should be prepared to hold for a while. 

5. If you really (!!!) want to rebalance I would seek myself some dPoS coin like NEO, ARK, (ETH, VEN in the future) that can create further coins even in a downswing simply by holding them - it's a lot less stressful if you know you're generating some income even tough the total valuation of your profile is going down.

6. Better times will come. Always have that in your mind.

7573,"I just read through all of the SEC's preliminary comments, and overall it was a fantastic statement. The only bad news I saw was still not expanding talks on Crypto ETF's. Also, with the role of protecting institutional and retail investors, where workers have put ""hard earned billions"" of dollars, you think the US will be responsible for not allowing people to cash out. You're a fucking idiot.

Here's some copy and pasted comments from the SEC: 
We are entering a new digital era in world financial markets. As we saw with the development of the Internet, we cannot put the technology genie back in the bottle. Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. . . . The evolution of these assets, their volatility, and the interest they attract from a rising global millennial population demand serious examination. With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight and private sector innovation, new technologies will allow American markets to evolve in responsible ways and continue to grow our economy and increase prosperity.
The testimony of Jay Clayton, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is worth a close read. At best, he's cautiously optimistic:
We have seen historical instances where such a rush into certain investments has benefitted our economy and those investors who backed the right ventures. But when our laws are not followed, the risks to all investors are high and numerous ‚Äì including risks caused by or related to poor, incorrect or non-existent disclosure, volatility, manipulation, fraud and theft. To be clear, I am very optimistic that developments in financial technology will help facilitate capital formation, providing promising investment opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike. . . . At the same time, regardless of the promise of this technology, those who invest their hard-earned money in opportunities that fall within the scope of the federal securities laws deserve the full protections afforded under those laws.
Crypto EFTs are not on the table yet:
Market participants have requested Commission approval for new products and services of this type that are focused on retail investors, including cryptocurrency-linked ETFs. While we appreciate the importance of continuing innovation in our retail fund space, there are a number of issues that need to be examined and resolved before we permit ETFs and other retail investor-oriented funds to invest in cryptocurrencies in a manner consistent with their obligations under the federal securities laws. These include issues around liquidity, valuation and custody of the funds‚Äô holdings, as well as creation, redemption and arbitrage in the ETF space.
And then he has quite a bit to say about ICOs:
[B]y and large, the structures of ICOs that I have seen involve the offer and sale of securities and directly implicate the securities registration requirements and other investor protection provisions of our federal securities laws.
. . .
Certain market professionals have attempted to highlight the utility or voucher-like characteristics of their proposed ICOs in an effort to claim that their proposed tokens or coins are not securities. Many of these assertions that the federal securities laws do not apply to a particular ICO appear to elevate form over substance. . . . Merely calling a token a ‚Äúutility‚Äù token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security. Tokens and offerings that incorporate features and marketing efforts that emphasize the potential for profits based on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others continue to contain the hallmarks of a security under U.S. law.
. . .
With the support of my fellow Commissioners, I have asked the SEC‚Äôs Division of Enforcement to continue to police these markets vigorously and recommend enforcement actions against those who conduct ICOs or engage in other actions relating to cryptocurrencies in violation of the federal securities laws. In doing so, the SEC and CFTC are collaborating on our approaches to policing these markets for fraud and abuse.",0.9969,daily_general_discussion_february_5_2018,0.045,0.786,0.169

Store wealth: E.g bitcoin. 
Daily use: E.g litecoin (lots need to happen but probably closest one to a daily use coin)

Eh, the China FUD was only about a 36% drop and a loss of $62B.  This one has been ~58% and *almost a half a trillion dollars*.  People will discount that and say BTC dropped 90% in 2013 but it only dropped single digit $B's then.  I get that percentages matter but this is (by far) the most significant dip/crash in the history of crypto given the market cap when it occurred.  Ask anyone if losing 90% of $10 or 60% of $10,000 is more significant, lol.

That said I'm bullish af at these prices.  Also the figures on this dip are a bit fucked due to CMC dropping SK exchanges but the point remains.

Regardless, paying for the lawyers resulted in a cascading slew of financial problems which forced me to basically liquidate most of my investments. One of the investments I stupidly decided to liquidate was of BTC because at the time they‚Äôd appreciated a good bit and there‚Äôd be no penalties (like a 401K).  I told myself I‚Äôd reinvest but never did.

>  We don't need the general public to get into crypto, we need heavy adoption so when we talk to people about cryptos it's about what they do and not how its price is going to go up. The problem is we're so hype fueled and essentially do nothing that benefits the average person at this point. All other dips have been for one sole reason, this one came out of the blue followed by all the FUD articles, tether, bitgrail, south korea, india ""ban"" etc. We've also never been down this long or experienced alts ranked highly fall so quickly, IOTA is down almost 5x, ripple down around 5-6x etc. I still think we'll recover at some point, but we need some serious adoption soon and I'm not talking about some coffee shop in the middle of nowhere accepting btc as a marketing scheme.

Basically I think we're going to be severely overvalued until we see major adoption which is expected. 

It's all how you look at it long term, I want to be able to talk to people about cryptos on what they do rather than how you can make money riding a wave and until then the market can go either way. Most of these coins probably aren't worth their value even with adoption, and that's the problem with the crypto space.",-0.9534,daily_general_discussion_february_3_2018,0.085,0.909,0.006

Sunday 1/7 had a very big drop.  We all now know what that was the start of.  BTC went from 16800 to 13550 that night.  

Next weekend, selloff started Saturday 6PM EST and went into Sunday morning at 7:30 PST.  14500-12700.  That leads into bloody Tuesday when we got the first glimpses of sub 10000 BTC.

Next weekend selloff again started Saturday Night the 20th at 10:30pm EST and went into Monday Morning  13000-10139.

Next weekend same, Sat evening peak (PST) 1/27 ended monday morning. 12244-10890

I haven't gone and looked at market cap for the corresponding times yet.  But I certainly expect the same types of drops. To me it seems more like a Friday to Saturday Pump and slow bleed usually ending Monday Morning.  

I was thinking of cashing and standing aside but really, there is no reason.  We are already heading down and will see 8500 again tomorrow through next week.  Sad truth of it.  Hopefully some folks got in on the Litecoin pump before it dumps.  Nothing will hold in this market.  It's a daytrader hype driven pump and dump and it's heading toward a flatline.

9211,"No no no that's not how any of this works.

You know how much money it requires for BTC to hit 1T marketcap on its own? $1. 

It is all tied to people perception of what it's worth. 

If all of a sudden the entire world decided that they would never sell a bitcoin because it is worth 1 unvigntillion dollars, then that's what it's worth.

It takes one trade of $1 for an infinitesimal fraction of BTC (say 1 Santoshi). Heck even one penny can make that happen. If then nobody wants to sell their BTC for less than this, the marketcap instantly becomes set at this.

It's an example to show how prices are determined, and how impactful perception is on the price of something. It's literally all that matters.",0.1531,daily_general_discussion_february_3_2018,0.049,0.884,0.068

I held for several weeks thinking it would probably bounce back since a very similar situation happened to XVG (eerily similar, actually) and it managed to bounce back to 85% of its high within a week.

Of course, the correction of TRX happened to coincide with the entire market crashing, so unfortunately it got the double-whammy.

I don't currently own any because I ended up trading it for TRAC, but I do think TRX will make a comeback at some point.

Basically you just use some kind of ETH wallet (e.g., Metamask) to send funds to the exchange, make your trade, and then withdraw your token to your wallet. Just be very careful putting any funds onto the exchange: because it's a decentralized exchange, it won't hold coins for you indefinitely, so you must make absolutely certain that you withdraw them to your wallet before closing your browser.

It's recommended to set up Metamask, which is essentially a wallet in a browser plugin.

1. Send Ethereum from my usual wallet to my Metamask wallet

2. Select Metamask from the drop-down menu in the top right corner of the Etherdelta website, and ""Deposit"" from my Metamask wallet onto Etherdelta

3. Buy TRAC, being *very careful* to make sure everything was correct before placing a buy order, because the exchange is not forgiving if you get it wrong

4. ""Withdraw"" from Etherdelta back to my Metamask wallet

5. Send the TRAC from Metamask to my original wallet.

By the way, every step on the exchange will require a small amount of Ethereum for transaction fees, and the Ethereum must be in the Metamask wallet. So you shouldn't deposit *all of it* onto the exchange.

As far as INT and ITC, after much research I still cannot tell which one is more legitimate and has more potential. Haven't heard of Space Chain yet. 

While it is not exactly IoT related, I believe HPB is the most solid and promising coin from the list of undervalued, relatively new Chinese coins. After the upcoming Kucoin listing, I will shift some money from HPB into BTO, CPC, and possibly ITC since I'm already on Bibox. Last time I checked there was no way for Americans to buy INT because it was only on exchanges that did not permit accounts for those in the US. 

But all these have serious potential to increase by 20-100x over the next year. Perhaps diversify now, but as you learn about them more and start to get a favorite one, shift money to that.

9936,"Essentially it comes down to this:

- BTC is the big dog in this market, the one most people know of, the one they equate with cryptocurrency. There's an underlying assumption that Bitcoin will continue to grow over time, and just holding bitcoin has worked out very well for everyone so far in the long term. Historically, just by holding BTC you'd already be doing better than the traditional stock market by a large margin.

- Many people investing in alts are doing so under the assumption that they will outpace BTC's growth, and they have more room to expand. So by trading against Bitcoin, you're doing so in the hope that you can ""beat it"". If you're not beating bitcoin, you would've been better off just holding BTC.

So by looking at BTC value, the goal at the end of the day is to end up with more BTC worth of your coin of choice. So if you start off with 1 BTC worth of Nano and it eventually grows into 3 BTC, you've beaten Bitcoin's growth.

Increasingly, the same applies to Eth too if you trade in Eth pairs.",0.9704,daily_general_discussion_february_3_2018,0.014,0.848,0.138

This post is being removed as low-quality content.

Threads that add little value to community discussion are often better suited for your coin/token's home subreddit.

These include things like:

* Pre-announcements.

* Logo changes.

* New members to foundations.

* Self-promotional tweets, news and statements from the founding team.

* etc

These types of post often get brigaded and lead to a lot of controversy in /r/cryptocurrency and so are being removed.

If you feel that this thread does add valuable discussion about a coin or token, and can foster rationale conversation (both for and against the currency), please message the moderators via ModMail requesting re-approval.",-0.9509,daily_general_discussion_february_3_2018,0.092,0.853,0.055

Abbrasive story CUT/PASTE here:

I'm going to explain how market valuations work, how pricing works and is determined, and I'm going to do it by telling you a story about Billy, $7 bills and Autism. *My apologies for autism insensitivity.*

Billy is a fucking retard that grew up with no friends. Sure Chad and Fuckface  (unfortunate name) grew up on his street, but they never took Billy seriously, mostly because he was always eating glue.

These kids grew up and Chad married his high school sweetheart and became mayor of shitville. Fuckface, despite his shitty parents was a pretty smart kid and ended up getting 8 PHDs and a great job on Wall street.

One day, Billy got bored of tanking on his meat and went for a walk in the woods where he found a door under some leaves. He went inside and found a factory and a bunch of spooky skeletons. The factory made $7 bills, and there was 10 million of them.

Billy got pretty happy about this and went around trying to buy some fidget spinners in town but nobody would accept them as legal tender. Billy was sad. His bills were worth zero.

One day his toilet clogged because he tried flushing his $7 bills in frustration so he called Derek the plumber. Derek offered Billy $1 per bill, but only had $1000 to spend. Billy gladly accepted. Derek unclogged his toilet for him.

Billy didn't know it (he's fucking retarded after all) but his $7 bills marketcap was now $10M, even though only $1000 was spent. It had risen to this because Billy had found a buyer willing to pay $1 per bill, thus that is the value of his cache. 

Billy, being a retard, thought his bills were still useless but Derek kept coming over once a week offering to buy some bills for $1 each. Eventually word spread around town and he had many people knocking on his door, and he sold many more bills for $1 each.

Oddly enough, even though now $10000 had been spent, when he checked CMC he noticed that his bills marketcap was still only $10M. 

He thought this was strange so he decided he would stop giving away his $7 bills for $1. The total amount of money he made so far was $10000, or rather $9900 because he still owed Chad $100 for the $5 loan he took out back in 1982 to buy his green turtle pool that Billy still bathed in.

Or at least that's what he believed.  In fact his paper portfolio was very likely ""worth"" much MUCH more ($7 bills and all). However since Derek was the only seller, and since Billy was gladly accepting $1 each, and since Billy represented 100% of all sellers, his erroneous perceived value of $1 actually made the $7 bill worth $1 in reality, regardless of what number is printed on the face of it. You see, if I haven't mentioned this already, he's a fucking retard.

Now the citizens of Shitville, being not much smarter than Billy, decide that he must also be right about the value of this $7 bill (being worth only $1, because seriously, who makes a $7 bill anyways?). So the town has generally agreed that these $7 bills should be worth $1 each and stores even start accepting them as barter. 

As time goes by, Fuckface returns home from the big city. He hears about this new bill and investigates. It turns out these are the real deal, and even have official serial codes n shit. He still doesn't think anyone outside shitville is stupid enough to buy a $7 though. Nonetheless word spreads around town that Fuckface thinks these are real. People start offering $2 a bill, then 3, then $4, etc. 

You see this is how the value of an asset is determined. Something is only worth what the general consensus believes it is worth.

Time goes by and price has risen above $7 to $10. These have some cool art on the after all and they have become a status symbol. Sure it says $7 on it, but when Billy takes it to Fred the grocer, Fred let's him take home $10 worth of pornmags so who cares?

Chad gets wind of this and calls Fuckface up. Fuckface starts seeing people in the big city start carrying these $7 bills around as a fad. Fuckface and Chad are no dummies though, but they kind of want a part of the pie. It turns out these have value more than the $7 printed on them because they are rare as fuck and are collectables.

Chad and Fuckface, after being sad that they missed the boat, come up with an ingenious plan. 

The next day at the council meeting, Chad announces that the factory condition these were printed in was dangerous. Anyone holding the $7 bills were very likely to catch autism.

As news of this meeting (and that super smart and handsome Fuckface backing it), all autistics in shitville who are unable to think for themselves believe these bills cause autism. All of a sudden what was once a 100M market cap bill crashes to $20M, $2 per bill, literally instantly. 

It could have crashed to zero, but you see many people in town, being already fully autistic, are unafraid. Every single autistic person now controlled all these coins. Except for two others, you guessed it, Fuckface and Chad, who gobbled up as many as they could.

The market cap is now $20M.

A day later, one autistic sells a coin to another autistic (one single coin) for $1. The market cap is now $10M.

Now $10M did not exit the system. Only $1 did. 

You see, once the General consensus was that people should no longer trade a $10 bill for this new $7 bill, and even worse, it was perceived to only be worth $1 coin, the ""value"" immediately fell to that point. This happened the very second one of the autistics were able to get their hand on one single bill for $1. The seller determined he would meet the sale price, and since nobody else was willing to buy it for $2, the entirety of every single bill is now worth $1 each until people decide otherwise.

It remained at this value for a long time, as nobody was brave enough to get autism, not even Chad and Fuckface, because they just took a 50% hit and were afraid only autistics would buy their coin, and only for $1 now.

Billy, after starting with 10 million $7 bills no longer has any $7 bills. Despite being fully autistic, he was afraid to keep any $7 bills because of double autism reasons.

Regardless, Chad and Fuckface assess their situation and realize they are surrounded by idiots and that they are the only people that know that $7 are truly legit.

fuckface, who is greatly respected, makes a press announcement that he has conducted research, and his 53 PHDs conclude that the $7 is both totally legit and free of any autistic pathogens such as trace vaccinations.

Long term, the $7 bill returns to its full value, and even a bit higher due to its rarity. You see, Fuckface fell down the stairs carrying his bags and died on impact. His entire stash was auctioned off and people paid extra for this collectable, because he scribbled a minuscule dickbutt in the corner of every bill and signed, ""Bamboozled - Fuckface"".

TLDR - don't let Fuckface convince you that your $7 bill is worth $1, because the moment you do, that very second, IT IS.  Even if little to no money actually left the fucking system.

Edit: also, don't believe that a $7 bill is worth $10 unless there is a damn good reason for it, such as the rare and collectable immutable dickbutt signature.

Billy sold out his future in fear of double autism, and gave it all to Chad who has been giving Billy wedgies for 30 years, and just laid the coup-de-gras atomic wedgie of a lifetime on poor Billy.",-0.9947,daily_general_discussion_february_2_2018,0.132,0.752,0.117

However, if we purely base the coin's valuation on that, it's probably not worth billions of dollars, if we were to be really objective.

Most of crypto is way overvalued today based on fundamentals alone. And by most, I mean 99.9%. Coins like Vechain/WTC are just less overvalued. 

Of course, there's a good chance they'll become even more overvalued and the entire space continues to bubble, in which case vechain/wtc etc are pretty solid choices, because they have better fundamentals than most.

If I could offer you, on peice of advice
Buying the dips would be IT

Long term benefits have been proved by hodlers,

Whereas the rest of my advice not financial, but that of my own meandering experience.

I will dispense this advice now.

Enjoy the power and beauty of neos divadent.

Well never mind 

You will not understand the power of Neo until the meltup.

But trust me 

You‚Äôll look back at your portfolio and recall this dip in a way you can‚Äôt grasp how much possibility lay befor you,

And how fabulous this tech really is.

You are not as fucked as you imagine 

Don‚Äôt worry about the FUD

Or fuding but know that fudding is affective as trying to solve etheriums scalability problems by chewing bubble gum

The real problems in life are Shiller and scammers and people who shout bitconnct on stages and selling to buy lower 

The kind of shorting that keeps you up at 4am I‚Äôm some idle Tuesday 

Do one thing every day that‚Äôs not crypto.

Sing

Don‚Äôt be wreakless with trainding into different coins. Don‚Äôt put up with you tubers who are shilling you theirs

Research

Don‚Äôt waist your time on jealousy; sometimes you‚Äôre ahead, sometimes you‚Äôre behind 

The race is long, and in the end, it‚Äôs only with profits.

Remember the dips you recive, forget the spikes.

If you succeed in doing this 

Tell me how.

Keep your capital gains history.
Throw away your letters from work asking where you‚Äôve gone.

Stretch

Don‚Äôt feel guilty if you don‚Äôt know what you want to do with your life 

The most interesting people I know didn‚Äôt join crypto till 2017 Most of all the people I know till havnt.

Get plenty of backups for your privet keys
Be empty with your exchanges, you‚Äôll miss them when their gone.

Maybe you‚Äôll hodl, maybe you won‚Äôt.

Maybe you‚Äôll buy the dips, maybe you can‚Äôt.

Maybe you‚Äôll give to chairty or maybe you‚Äôll dance the funky chicken As you buy your 75th lambo to the collection

Whatever you do don‚Äôt congratulate yourself too much or d√©rate yourself either

Your crypto pics are half chance 

So are everybody else‚Äôs 

Enjoy takeing out your initial investment.
Keep it safe in every way you can.
Don‚Äôt be afraid of holdings, or what other people think of it.

It‚Äôs the greatest instrument you‚Äôll ever own

Dance 

Even if you are in the minus and are in a crash.
Read the directions and know that bulls will follow them.

Do NOT read get rich quick referral ponzi scheams, they will only make humanity feel ugly.

BROTHER AND SISTER TOGETEHRR WE‚Äôll MAKE IT THROUGH.

SOME DAY THE BLOCK CHAIN WILL TAKE YOU AND GIUD YOU THERERERR

I KNOW YOUVE BEEN HURTING BUT IVE BEEN WAITING TO BE THERE FOR YOU

Also whenever I've gotten overly fancy in these situations (like the mid January dip) it became apparent in hindsight that I would have in fact been much better off had I just held throughout the dip rather than played musical chairs. 

Beyond that I can't offer much.  Good luck.

However, I think that in the next bull market, once the mainstream alts (VEN, ICX, NEO) all recover a fair amount, we'll see the low-MC altcoins surge again.

So I'd wager that right now coins like BNTY have gone from high-risk/high-reward coins to *very* high-risk / *very* high-reward.

The following Simple Token features are expected to launch in February. These are major milestones, not just for OST but for entrepreneurs, companies/businesses looking to stay ahead of their competition, and the entire crypto world in general.

According to the roadmap, February will be an extremely exciting month for OST.

- ostKIT alpha (Feb 2018): The first public version of OST's complete blockchain toolkit for businesses. In ostKIT alpha any company will be able to design an OST-powered token economy and simulate transactions on testnet. ostKIT alpha is being built for both business persons and developers, with robust API‚Äôs available for developer use. Groundbreaking for crypto. Coming February 2018.

- ostEXPLORER (Feb 2018): OST's home grown block explorer which will include insights into ETH transactions on the public block and on OpenST side chains. Coming February 2018.

- ostCAMPAIGNS (Feb 2018): The first crypto-powered complete enterprise grade email marketing solution. Currently processing millions of monthly transactions under a different brand name. Will be made available as a standalone product and integrated into ostKIT over time. Volume-based billing, only in $OST. Coming February 2018.

Additional Developments:

- The first ostKYC customers launching/going live soon

- Info and news around the new OST branding coming soon

- New partnerships coming soon

OST is about to make a huge splash in February 2018.  Also, check this out...OST's circulating supply decreases over time, as companies use OST to brand their own tokens.

If it were to drop 25% from $20, (a quarter of the price), it'd be worth $15.00 - since 1/4 of $20 is $5.

There was a huge amount of standing buy orders down there which were automatically triggered causing the volume & price to jump up. That leads to bots & retail investors rushing back into buy, pushing price & volume up further. 

After the volume dries up, the price moves sideways for a some time before continuing the downward trend.  Same thing happened yesterday after BTC bounced off the $8750 support and also back on Jan. 17 when it touched $9K. 

Problem is that the bounces keep getting smaller, lows getting lower, and the ""recoveries"" are getting shorter before we hit new lows. That's usually a sign of decreasing market confidence. Until the bots are reigned in and people stop rushing in to buy as soon as they see a green candle and sell as soon as they see a red one, it's likely the trend will continue. 

You'll know we hit the bottom when buying & selling volumes dry up and the price moves sideways for a few weeks. Trying to time the ""recovery"" on the day it starts is a fool's errand. ",-0.0031,daily_general_discussion_february_2_2018,0.068,0.87,0.063

12758,"I expect so. This inevitable drop to the bottom was intentionally extended by market manipulation this morning as America came online, simultaneous pump across multiple exchanges, now slowly tapering off as the new buys are mopped up.

It will go below 8k again tonight, and probably hit the real bottom later in the weekend or monday. I hope the real bottom is only 6k.

Then I expect a major rally back maybe to 10k, and then a succession of bounces off the bottom over the next month.

Maybe in march we might see real organic growth again, depending to some extent on external factors.

12815,"You'll never escape the cycle of gains and sell offs, because every market, including the New York Stock Exchange, endures the same cycle. 

What will happen is the volatility will reduce, and it will reduce in correlation with adoption. 

Because there is virtually *no* adoption or widespread use of cryptocurrency right now, it means investors are easily spooked.  Even though its obvious at this point that this will be ubiquitous in the future, there's still a huge amount of uncertainty, and that will always result in higher volatility. 

Vitalik's recent Twitter quote pointing to how little adoption and real use-cases crypto has is indicative of why it's so easy for regular investors to get so spooked.  Because they aren't *really* certain this whole thing isn't a giant scam that will dissappear tomorrow.  That uncertainty always lingers in their minds. 

Once these really break out, definitely within the next five years but maybe even sooner, you'll see a lot more confidence and therefore a lot less volatility - but there will still be swings.",0.8814,daily_general_discussion_february_2_2018,0.034,0.875,0.091
12816,"Nobody knows because this has never happened before. No tulips, no internet, and no 1929 crash can be even remotely compared to crypto.

However, my educated guess remains a long-term strategy wherein you seek out promising tech. Keep the risk low (crypto 'low risk'). And buy the dips. Do not throw in all your fiat but spreas out your investment.  Cash out max 20% at peaks. Buy back in at a minimum of 20% market loss (roughly).

If you have any skill in trading I suggest you work with regular buy and sell orders on those stocks you 'know'. That means you have been around them long enough to 'feel' their relative movement. If you do not possess such stocks (yet) then I suggest you avoid daytrading.

The IRS is pretty lenient when people are making at least a good-faith attempt to represent their transactions.  If you miss and they catch you, but you've tried to represent what you owed by underepresented by some margin, they'll usually just bill you for any owed tax you may have missed without applying penalties and interest.

What they do not show leniency towards is obvious and deliberate attempts to conceal income.  Then you'll get hit with fines, interest in the pricipal, and potential criminal charges depending on the level of the deception.

And there is a *very* small pool of crypto traders relative to all taxpayers.

Though if you really think about it, 9.9k is where bitcoin was testing in mid December, so it really isn't that bad, it just looks horrendous.

The best thing anyone could've done was diversify in December when bitcoin was booming though. All alts that have expanded since then and held some good value.

Just as an example in December you had $30 neo and 19k bitcoin.  Turn one bitcoin into neo and in January you have $150 neo and $9.8k bitcoin. If you kept that bitcoin you lost 50% of your value, if you invested it you made 500%.

That's the underlying problem we face with cryptos at the moment, I would go as far as say 95% of the people invested in this space don't understand what they're investing into, but hope that it'll make them money. As more people become drawn into this idea of buying random coins as a way to make money, these coins become heavily overvalued for what they intend to do. That's why there's always speculation that we're in a bubble, because at the moment there is not a single coin that is being used for its intended purpose that matches the current price of it besides ETH/BTC I suppose. We could be in a huge bubble until all these cryptos are at a point where they are no longer speculative and actually do something that matches their value, or on the other hand we're just simply early investors.",0.9032,daily_general_discussion_january_30_2018,0.03,0.868,0.102

16315,"Under usual circumstances, coins often pump in anticipation of the listing on a big exchange and then immediately correct once they hit the exchange. XRB, however, is a very special case for several reasons. First of all, XRB won the coin of the month contest, so the pump that often comes with a listing was priced in as soon as it was foreseeable that XRB would come out as the winner of this contest. Around this time we saw the ATH. Since then, it has corrected significantly, meaning that the usual pump and dump around an exchange listing has already happened in this case.

Second, XRB was only available on shitty exchanges for a long time, and whole Mercatox and Bitgrail drama has hurt the XRB price badly. Kucoin is a different story - for whatever reason basically every coin exclusively listed on Kucoin was dumped really hard through January - and I still don't really understand why that is the case. I find it really hard to tell how this has also influenced the price of XRB. 

Third, it's hard to tell how many people are holding their XRB in a wallet and only suffered through the recent dumps because they didn't want to return their XRB to Mercatox and/or Bitgrail. It's possible that many people want to get rid of their heavy XRB bags once they can sell it on Binance. On the other hand, there will be others who just wait for XRB to hit Binance to finally buy some - many people have avoided Bitgrail and Mercatox (and as we see, for good reason). In the end, it depends on whether there are more people that want to buy than people that want to sell.

My personal feeling is that everybody that urgently wanted to sell did so on KuCoin over the past few days. Those people that sold on Bitgrail today had no other option - they sold because of Bitgrail, not because of XRB. Many of these people will want to buy back in, because they are still convinced of XRB. So actually, I expect XRB, after a few hours/days of massive price swings when it hits Binance, to go on a bull run for the following few weeks.

What exchange is that value based on? Every exchange will have different prices.

When it was just BitGrail and Mercatox, there was a difference of about $5 to $6 per coin at certain points between exchanges.  I would assume that gap existed because you rarely could withdraw your XRB from either site, so they were essentially two islands of value.  There was also a huge gap on BitGrail between XRB's value in their BTC exchange and their ETH exchange.

16751,"OMG is one of the best use cases for crypto. It's a white wallet that aims to focus on lesser developed areas of the world such as Southeast Asia and Africa. Many people in these areas don't have banks accounts, and because of this they have to use many centralized services to pay for things in various ways with their cash. For example, PMobile for cell phones. Instead of having a million different services to utlize their cash, OMG's white wallet will conglomerate all these services into one wallet, and allow their currencies, whether it be cash or crypto, to be converted seamlessly behind the scenes while also creating a trustless relationship between the unbanked and service providers. 

The OMG token helps maintain the decentralization of the service by encouraging owners to stake (with returns) and maintain the network.

It is the first and premier project for Ethereum's plasma scaling solution, and looks to be fully operational this summer. Vitalik, the creator of Ethereum, is listed as an offical adviser. It's also one of the older Ethereum-based projects with a strong foundation, unlike many new shiny projects which are little more than a white paper and won't produce anything beyond a beta/test net in 2018. 

Last but not least, it's one of the few projects that has seen little price movement since the December hysteria. I interpret this to mean it's extremely undervalued. The price hasn't risen likely because it's an actual real economic use that is a dense subject for many first world investors who are new to crypto to understand. It's hard for people in Europe or the US to understand why something like this is extremely valuable when they've been banked their whole lives and know nothing about how this area of the world operates.

Im an SLR hodler, so Im fairly biased, but SolarCoin is great because as price increases, the incentive to claim increases.

Im also intreagued by Power Ledger and HODL a bit, I think they have a much bigger challenge because they are going into a highly regulated space (energy trading) and are really aiming to deconstruct the status quo; so its going to be interesting how they manage realtionships over time.

I am a Solar Energy installer and developer and have spent a very fair amount of time digging into the renewable energy world of crypto. Full disclosure, I do own quite a bit of SLR so perhaps I am biased, but I try not to be.

SLR is the most established of the renewable energy based tokens. SLR is the exact same thing as a Renewable Energy Credit (REC) except it is not tied to a government. You can receive SLR in one of three ways, by registering your Solar Panels on their website with proof of ownership (Power bill), by directly logging your kWh produced onto the blockchain, or by running a full node on the on the SLR network.

POWR is the Australian ICO that drummed up a lot of support from a great marketing team, but in the end, much like many of the ICOs, is a load of garbage. They talk a lot about ‚Äúenergy trading‚Äù but many people don‚Äôt seem to understand that for this concept to prevail it would require quite a bit of rewiring on the power grid.

It's pretty obvious really. Grassroots movement finally lets avg Joe get access to investment tool before big money. 

Big money waits until this thing looks real and isn't going away.

Big money wants a piece of the pie.

They spam FUD everywhere, get weak hands to sell and depress price. 

They take your money because you are weak and panic. They are pros and have been dominating this game for decades. They are no idiots.

They get in cheap and literally take your money.

Big money has now entered the game and you all have given up your early access advantage.

Do not expect this to change. It will only get worse as crypto shows signs of being a real solid investment that isn't going to pop. It's going to get worse and worse and worse until you ave all given your weak hand money to the people who have been stealing from you your whole lives.

If you think they are going to let you take their power from them you are wrong. If you stop and think for 5 seconds how they wrestle back control of this situation before the power flips the tables on them, they do it with constant barraging of news releases, threats of bans, credible investors talking about bubble pops and market hacks. They do this relentlessly until you finally believe them and sell your stake.

Then you've lost this game and the power struggle with the super rich continues, and hell, even gets worse than it ever has.

Anyone that sells back to fiat at anytime is risking losing their position, selling out their futures and giving it back to the mega rich.

Then ICO's are now switching to letting you use GAS to get in. Now not only can you hold onto your NEO but now you have another reason to hold your GAS / buy more.

Not to mention just about all the NEO is out there and it isn't even that big of a supply so price can go really high. 

Plus it's on many exchanges already + margin trading.

If the price starts rising too quickly, and people start buying into your sell wall, then drop it and place it at a slightly higher price.

I have big hopes for Rentberry though - already established platform, and looks like hardcap will be reached soon with less then 150m tokens total - giving them a really low marketcap to start off with at the current ICO price of .40 per token (~100m marketcap?)

Definatly capable of becoming a top 50 coin at least imo during 2018 given that they already have the platform, partners and a working product before they even entered ICO - most coins have neither.  And to hit the CURRENT top 50 it would more then 6x, and thats by the estimates of a market that haven't even recovered from the January crash yet.  By April/May crypto marketcap will probably be over 1 trillion, and if everything scales equally that would give BERRY a potential 12x if it hits top 50 by that time...

17991,"VEN's biggest 'problem' is it isn't very sexy. Even when it makes pretty big partnership deals, it's not with companies that many consumers know or care about.

But make no mistake, those partnerships are big businesses. VEN has clients on their blockchain as we speak. 

For example Shanghai Waigaoqiao Direct Imported Goods Ltd. or D.I.G. This is a multi billion dollar company. They are using VeChain currently for all their Wine imports into China. Something like 30% of all wine going into China is done though D.I.G., and is on VeChains blockchain. I guess you can even use the app, scan you wine, make sure it came from a specific vinyard, cask, age, etc.

The government of China put together a 5 year plan to build the city of Gui'an into a new National Data Center of the west/Smart City.  Big time investments in Big Data, Cloud Computing, and of course, BlockChain. China is dropping billions on this project. Microsoft and Apple are both in on this project for over a billion. IBM, Foxcon, Huawei, are all building data centers in Gui'an as well. And guess who the National partner for Blockchain technology is? VeChain baby. VeChain is going to power this new Smart City in China and it's going to be bad ass. [Source on the Gui'an smart city.](https://cdn.vechain.com/vechain_national_government_partnership_guian_release.pdf)

These are real deal, existing partnerships and products. Not vapor ware. Not promises. Signed and sealed. It's going to be interesting to see what happens.

19064,"I feel that you can be confident that X or Y coin is going to perform well over the next 6 months, or next 5 years, say, and yet still not invest in it because you think that ETH or BTC will perform better for at least some point in the future. Whether this means you don't bother investing now and wait a bit longer before you do, or just not bothering at all is up to you.  
   
As far as I can tell, the market is still immature, and the majority of products certainly are. The most mature projects are BTC, LTC, and ETH (and Ripple etc). By the time X or Y challenger coin has created a robust network and ecosystem around it, there is potential for another challenger to have emerged with as much or greater promise. The challenge to ETH or BTC does not come from another coin having better tech alone, but a better network and ecosystem as well. 

Equally, you may still feel that daytrading is the kind of investing you want to do. If so, you may still want to have a long term objective in mind, especially as it relates to my second paragraph above. Let's take the migration of ETH over to Proof of Stake, and the introduction of sharding and plasma over the next 2 years. Assuming that these go well, lets say the price of ETH moons to such a point that an immature coin/alt that today is 0.05 ETH, which grew before it mooned to 0.1 ETH, goes down to 0.025 ETH. The best single time to buy that coin if you want to hold it until it matures is when the price is 0.25, so you may speculate that you should just hold ETH until it goes to say $10000 per ETH, and then distribute into alts. The optimum move you could make would be to buy the coin at 0.5, sell at 0.1, and buy twice as much of the coin when the price goes to 0.25.   

My belief is that ETH (and BTC) will mature first, and that as I invest on the basis that cryptocurrency may or can become globally significant, and this will only occur if the currencies are sufficiently mature, I ought hold onto the ones that will achieve this.

So here is what I am thinking.  Even though VEN is relatively down right now, it is very volatile and capable of going on big runs in short amount of time.  So I have somewhat of high sell limits for VEN right now and I am hoping that it hits.  Once (if) they hit, then I can consider two options: (1) buy more ICX with the VEN or (2) wait for VEN to dip again to rebuy.  I feel like this gives me a lot of flexibility on what to do while the only downside is if VEN keeps on surging while ICX does not surge as much VEN from that point onward.

If you're talking fiat, then the ratio of gains relative to ETH is irrelevant, since ETH is just a middleman to get to fiat (except for the trade fees, you'd get the same amount of fiat no matter what ETH's price does).

If you're talking about converting to ETH and holding ETH, then in your example you would have made no gains (and in fact would lose due to exchange fees). If you bought 10 ICX for 1 ETH , and both went up by 10%, you still only be able to trade the ICX back for 1 ETH (again, ignoring exchange fees).

Not sure if one is better than the other. In terms of making an investment decision only you can decide if it's a better to choose one over the other, or support both in whatever proportions you want. 

I can't speak to Ripple because I haven't done any diligence on that project. But I did take a brief look at Stellar. Their use cases include remittances, micropayments, mobile money. Their team is very strong. They are product-focused and have a high level of professionalism. Unlike many of the projects in the space, they have been adopted by different companies to some extent (Deloitte, IBM). Some believe the float is too large to see large gains in the future. But there is a chance to earn some income through their inflationary pools. 

Hopefully, I've given you a decent research lead here. Both Ripple and Stellar have use cases that might be the most likely to be adopted on a larger scale sooner than the other projects. Disclaimer: I hold a position in Stellar Lumens.",0.984,daily_general_discussion_january_28_2018,0.0,0.86,0.14

I don't try to time the market, but I do try to buy mostly during dips. However, buying something green at $20 while it's on it's way to $25 is better than buying the dip at $22 hypothetically.

Using WTC and VEN as an example - they're both incredibly promising coins, but the FUD that surrounds one when it starts to stagnate (WTC mid-month, and VEN to an extent now) is so obviously a product of group-think from a group of individuals who FOMOed into the coin at its ATH and were subsequently burned. These individuals will be more prone to sell at a loss and will thus much more readily accept FUD and be willing to spread it.

The same effect is obviously true the other way. Earlier this week when VEN was mooning, the hype surrounding it was incredible, 'this thing is going to $20', and now, there is apparently no end in sight for WTC.

21003,"Ya, it's a bit tricky.  Most crypto is measured relative to BTC and BTC is measured relative to fiat.  If you're trading in ETH, it's preferable (IMO) to just work on accumulating more ETH - so measuring your profits/losses relative to ETH.  If you make a trade and come out ahead in USD, but down in ETH then it wasn't a good trade.  You could do the same with BTC if you prefer.  That's what most people do.  But because of the extreme fluctuations it's not always helpful to look at fiat.  The whole market tends to move together.  I'd rather move up relative to ETH and down in USD than vice versa because I know that ETH is going to be worth more on the long run anyway.  It doesn't really matter what the dollar value is worth at any particular time unless I'm looking to take profits - in which case I'd wait for an upswing.

&

Heres a little bit of advice, When dicking around on the internet and searching "" Top Coins of 2018"" or "" How to Turn 100 into 100K"" Try researching things like ""Pirvate Key Vs Public Key"" How to Identify a Scam Coin""  and Videos with opinionated merit because those articals and videos may not always be right but at lease they are trying to educate real worth while info and not shit like CRYPTO NICK.

&

I'm a fan of youtubers like DataDash and Coin Mastery.  Check some of their videos out. They try and provide value for their subs. 

&

Depending on where you are in the world you need to find an exchange that has a good Fiat on ramp. meaning Bank account - exchange so you can turn cash into coins. In the US the biggest player is Coinbase. they only trade 4 things but once you get verified you can get money into coins quickly. 

&

Then i use other exchanges like Binance and Kucoin to get into other ALT coins to diversify.

21430,"I'm in on both. I'll be clear here. I am a poor person by 1^st world standards. I work in food supply chain for a multinational pizza chain. 

I feel like AMB is something my business could absolutely use over the clunky system our supply chain currently uses with possible failures in order lead times, balancing production, Qualcomm, dispatch, tracking, and accuracy/timeliness of shipments. 

AMB is cheaper and we don't have to worry about infrastructure going down or people fudging numbers. I can tell you that, at the customer level, the restaurants would drool over a device that can accurately count their stock, in just a few minutes, and have that logged for enterprise software to track. In-store tracking of food and labor costs make or break these businesses.

Franchise owners will adopt if they own more than just a few stores and it could easily be implemented over existing enterprise-class software with REQ to make invoices move through the system at lightning speed.  The Data alone on trends and costs that can be pulled from the chain are unreal. 


I think adoption of these systems need not come from major conglomerates. Often our commissaries (who are also franchise owned) are the first to try new things and change how the supply chain works in their patch of the larger organization. Integration into the current system is key, though. Change is good and all, but drastic change can cause chaos. Something as simple as dough tracking could be instrumental in spurring more integration; or rather decentralization. If they push for adoption both above and below AMB can succeed in ""Farm to Fork"" tracking which would be an amazing advertisement for any business.

Stakeholders are in control rather than miners, and it is self-funding so need to rely on funding from outside interests whose interests may not align with those of stakeholders (e.g. Blockstream). Ultimately, it's governance system will enable it to easily grow and adapt in the future.

Other than that, there are a few great developments coming up: Lightning Network integration, enhanced privacy, Ledger support. The dev team is one of the best around, very innovative and meticulous in making sure things are done right.

Try to estimate the value of B2X from futures on Bitfinex/other places (not necessarily the price given on Bitfinex. For BTG I assumed half of the futures price). Try to estimate which support level BTC will drop to. I sell before/after the fork depending on what's more profitable.

For BTG I sold a few hours before the fork. I then started rebuying my BTC in increments, with bigger chunks the lower the price went. I was hoping it would reach $5000, as I had a big chunk waiting to rebuy then. It didn't hit that so the plan is to just rebuy whatever I have left when the price returns to what I originally sold at.

If I'm doing USD/ETH|BTC I use GDAX, or Coinbase if its just a quick buy. I'm registered on Gemini though in case GDAX is down.

If I'm trading an ERC20 token my preferred exchange is EtherDelta. Once I figured out why it is the way it is, I actually really like it. As long as I'm not in a hurry and don't need the volume of a larger exchange (e.g. bought ~4000 LINK last night, wasn't in a rush and just let the buy order get filled over like ~2 hours + price was lower than Binance). Also really like that when I'm done, I can just open the wallet in MEW to make sure I get every last bit of the ETH out.

If it's not an ERC20 or I need the trade to happen faster I'll use Bittrex.

If I absolutely have to (e.g. Bittrex hasn't listed it yet), I'll use Liqui. Last time I had to do this though was to get DNT right before it went on it's run and I had to deal with my deposited ETH not showing up for 8+ hours. Liqui is (probably) fairly trustworthy, but can't handle heavy loads of traffic yet so I avoid it unless I have to.

RFID blockchain combo. Patented hardware that drastically improves the typical rfid chip, for a competitive price. Billion dollar companies partnered with WTC that will use it for their supply chain management. China has a real need for a supply chain overhaul, especially in the clothing industry, where Walton has a huge advantage because the director of supply chain for Septwolves is the founder of Walton. They have angel investors, won a competition that gave them over a million dollars in funding and a serial run of their product by the fujian govt. The team is immaculate, which includes the much talked about ex-VP of Samsung who holds around 60 patents. They have a prototype of the rfid chip that they will be showing us next month, their wallet and mainchain release is at most about 2 weeks away but could be as early as a week away. They've also promised 2 korean exchanges after the release, and they're working on more exchanges beyond that. Their masternode will have an aspect of seniority, meaning the longer you stake, the higher your reward will be. We can also infer that you can stake without a masternode, as they've said before that the masternode gains *extra* rewards. The market cap is still low, just below 200 million. Many believe it should have a billion dollar valuation. The team is very responsive and posts frequent AMAs. They are very transparent and professional, despite the translation barrier, but they are getting better. This barrier is likely the source of its price suppression and low valuation.

From my understanding, which is not 100% I warn you, is that that controller helps to secure the network for now, while the volume of transactions on the network isn't enough to secure it naturally (it may be susceptable to a ""31% attack""). Once the network gets more usage, the controller will be turned off as the high number of transactions occurring will be securing the network fully.

They turned it off the other day to update a few things and the network continued working completely fine using the full nodes on the network, which shows that it isn't an essential component - proving that the system works without it.

Basically I can either hope my fraction of a bitcoin or ether gains to the moon by crypto as a whole becoming a main stream thing... Or I can buy some alts and try move back into ether, bitcoin, neo...whatever I consider safe coins to be when I have increased my satoshi count. 

It is certainly risky. I did my research and laid out what I had over about 15 alts. Did not hold ANY bitcoin or Eth in the hope that I could out do my portfolio. 

Basically I have some good buys, some decent buys, quite a few down buys and 2 1/2 that really did beautiful things for me. 

I still think the alt market is depressed and will be so till seg so I actually feel good about my position even though I am slightly about even with what I put in bitcoin wise. 

Considering the alt market vs bitcoin currently I actually think I am in a great spot.... we will see. 

If you are holding super super long term them I think the risk of alts go way up. I think it's something you kind of have to be following a bit more. 

I am just rambling. 

My advice.... keep in mind I am noone. 

If you reaaaallly believe in Eth then put 70% there. 20-25% in another coin you research that you consider really a long term player and then find another smaller coin you think can make you 10,000 gains. Basically this is a beautiful way to test your mind and research ability and see what you are made of. It also never hurts to keep researching and finding opportunities.

Edit: A bottom line is I think there is too much risk and unkown about crypto to only hold one coin.

Both coins are not necessarily worth the same after the fork because one coin may have more support behind it.  For instance, we can look at the Bitcoin cash fork.  This fork was a little tricky because it wasn't clear-cut which coin would come out on top after the fork, but the educated guess was that Bitcoin Core would remain on top.  The overall support of the community leaned towards Bitcoin Core, and that's why the Bitcoin Cash value is only ~5% of Bitcoin's.

705,"When you buy stocks in a company, each company has a different product or service they are providing. They aren't all selling the exact same thing.

Crypto currencies are similar in that respect. One coin will focus on privacy, another may focus on fast transactions in the network or even allow applications to be built using the coins blockchain. 

Bitcoin has the most value because there is a limited amount of coins available. It does not claim to be the fastest or even private but it's the most widely used to trade between fiat (real money).",0.4398,daily_general_discussion_october_20_2017,0.015,0.929,0.056
706,"When you buy stocks, you make money if the value rises and sell the stock. The same logic applies here, but with stocks you need to buy 1 full share at a time, with coins you can buy fractions / decimals. You can buy 0.425342 bitcoin if you want, which makes it possible for any financial level to invest and still experience the same rate of return as someone buying more cryptocurrency.  

There are a lot of subjective answers to ""where does it get its value"" so I will just throw a few things here on this point - the network of computers / machines running the bitcoin software around the world, are securing the network, verifying transactions, and making sure that each person spending bitcoins, has those coins to spend, and is not spending the same coin twice. Every coin can be tracked on the bitcoin ledger that the whole world can all see. This makes it very secure, and nobody can game the system or create coins without permission of the network. All the rules are programmed into the software, so there are no shady bankers creating money out of thin air. 

The value of a coin is very speculative right now, but ther IS ways to value coins if your looking at longer term investing. From week to week or day to day, the value shift is more speculative, but for longer term investing over the coming year lets say, there is much more to look into deeper to find coins worth investing, and to look out for flags that would suggest not investing.

At least 99% of altcoins will die within the next decade. Think about it in terms of sheer cash flow: only the top 25 altcoin ICO's have raised > $30 mil. The average of all other ICO's is at most 10 mil. We assume that 30%-50% of altcoins fail for non-business related reasons, ex. project was a scam. The other 50-70% have an operating expenditure of > $500k - $1 mil (5-10 devs paid $100k) and capital expenditure of at least $100k year-over-year. Assuming a linear rate of growth of $100k to opex and $50k to capex per year, within a decade their opex will be at least $1 mil and capex at least $600k. Most of these projects will likely not get even CLOSE to HALF of that amount in revenue per year from business, and run out of money around that 1 decade cliff. We can assume this because of the sheer competition in the space (multiple duplicate niche-fillers).

- What does it have over, let's say Monero?

- ""Filters and categorisation systems to help find goods."" No shit, wouldn't be a market without that.

- private listings: who can view them and what is the point? Why do I need an ecommerce platform when access is ""invite-only"" or however that is supposed to work? I could just contact the seller by other means and make a transaction with any cryptocurrency.

So they sold off 1/3 of their supply for an average of $0.31, to private investors.

I think this is why the price is taking a hit and will continue to sink.  People who brought in around $12 paid 40x what the original private investors paid.  The whole thing is shady to me, so I'm staying away from it.  Such a shame though, it was a promising idea.

As part of a compliance review, we have temporarily suspended certain accounts pending the completion of the review. The total number of suspended, closed, or banned accounts is very limited: less than 0.1% of the total accounts on Bittrex. More than 99.9% of Bittrex accounts are unaffected.
Any reports that Bittrex miscalculated or misapplied its exchange fees, that there is a security problem with the exchange, that Bittrex lost any coins stored on users’ behalf, or that Bittrex is banning people trying to access Slack to discuss the status of their accounts are incorrect. We are committed to making Bittrex a strong, safe, and compliant exchange where people can securely participate in the digital currency economy. We ask for patience from our highly valued customers.

The 1X chain may then suffer extreme transaction backlog and thus very high fees as it is quite susceptible to a loss of hash rate.

If it goes the other way, the 2X chain will only be half as affected due to the double capacity.

Just do the math if BTC goes from 5500 to 6200 and you invest only 500. Also I guess it will dip as usual in a month or two and you'll be able to buy cheaper. 

XRP is very interesting because there is a big conference coming this week. But it's not easy to predict how high it will go. We don't know if they'll make triggering announcements and I think it's not your usual crypto you can easily see pumped and manipulated. I'd say it's the most interesting investment between the 2 but for the long term. 

Then you have LTC, ETH, XMR... 
LTC is solid and improving. I love the head developer too, I think it has good value.
ETH is the future. It's very different from Bitcoin. I don't see how it wouldn't grow more. But it's already a bit expensive if you want to make a lot of gain.

1219,"Although I'm also new to world of cryptocurrency and all the intricacies surrounding it, what I understand to be true is that blockchain technology allows your digital identity and data to remain private through the usage of hash algorithms. What this means is that online services that make use of blockchain technology do not store your data in the traditional sense. Although Dropbox may encrypt your data on their servers, it's still readily available to them, since they are the intermediary between your data and the cloud-based service they offer.


Blockchain is different, however, as the person providing the information should be the only one that has access to this same information. The intermediary in the blockchain process (e.g. the Filecoin service) only creates a hash that represents your data, and erases it from their servers afterward. This means that the only control they have over your information is the control you provide them with i.e. providing key information to retrieve the corresponding information stored in a hash.


Because the internet is such a powerful network, there are many reasons why you'd want your data to be stored securely, without having an intermediary company such as Dropbox/Google be in control of it. Blockchain technology enables this and I'd take a guess that companies such as NASA would not want their data to be stored on a public network either.

Cryptos are designed for the modern, digital world.  Decimal places are not a problem.  With traditional coinage/bills, it wasn't possible to fraction a single coin, ie. you can't give someone 23.5% of a fifty-cent piece.  But with digital currencies, you just give them 0.235 units of one of your coins.  No big deal.

1834,"1) Really depends on which coins you want to buy. Bittrex is a good exchange imo but doesn't have all the coins I want, thus I also use Binance for instance. You can check on coinmarketcap.com which coins you can buy at which exchanges. 

2) You shouldn't really have to worry about losing that much because bitcoin isn't super likely to drop that much in a short time. But if you want to make sure you don't lose any gains, you could also trade to Tether after you've sold an altcoin. Tether tries to be 1 to 1 to the us dollar. But be warned: tether isn't super safe either because you basically have to trust them for their word.

If bitcoin/eth is in a slump, that'll mean you could end up waiting as much as a couple of months while you wait for the prices to recover (compared to EUR).

I don't think we'll see a drastic price rise in ETH until more features are added and utilized. The value of ETH hit the brickwall when everyone realized how slow the ETH network is under pressure. Raiden/Plasma are essential. DAPPs using zk-snarks are essential. 

I'm actually flirting with the idea to stop holding ETH because I consider it a ""transitional asset"" like BTC. TBH, I'm not flirting, I'm living it due to my portfolio going 4x since I stopped storing value in ETH or BTC.

1954,"> Did I make a good decision with Coinbase? And better options?

Yes. Coinbase is a good start. I like Kraken better because they have more cryptocurrency options.

> If I don’t want to buy one ~$4,000 bitcoin can I purchase a “partial” bitcoin? 

Yes. And it's a good idea to trade with very tiny amounts while you're getting started, and get familiar with the tools and technology.

> What is the standard bitcoin ticker symbol? 

There are unfortunately no standard symbols yet -- every exchange has its own. But typically you'll see either BTC or XBT for Bitcoin. (Note that BCC or BCH is ""Bitcoin Cash"" which is a different asset.)

> I’m able to purchase bitcoin via TDA, or an accurate ETN/ETF that reflects the bitcoin price.

Not yet, but there are ETFs and crypto funds currently being rolled out in some countries that track cryptos. (The concept of ""accuracy"" is not yet solid primarily because there are a variety of markets where these assets are traded.)

> I often see people saying to “remove the coins from Coinbase as soon as possible,” what exactly do they mean? 

Cryptocurrencies are inherently difficult to keep secure if you're not technically savvy -- and because of this hackers actively attack exchanges and other crypto related websites. I think that for the average user, it's way safer to keep your assets in a reputable exchange. In general, the likelihood of your average non-tech-savvy trader losing/destroying their assets is higher than an exchange getting attacked.

> Is Coinbase not secure? 

Yes, it is very secure. And one of the few exchanges that have explicit user-driven cold storage of assets.

> GDAX wants me to upload a PHOTO of my DRIVERS LICENSE, why? 

Regulations. KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti Money Laundering.) Almost all credible exchanges ask for lots of personal information. I'd go as far as saying: don't use exchanges that don't have these controls in place.

1955,"I am unable to answer some of your more technical questions but as far as coinbase goes I did research as well and it is one of the top exchanges people use in USA. You can buy partial bitcoins, not sure what the lowest limit is but you certainly don't need to spend hundreds of dollars. 

Information is definitely difficult to find and very conflicting. Focus first on understanding how Coinbase works and how to transfer your coins to a wallet. As far as I understand leaving the coins in an exchange exposes you to the risk of losing them. 

In order to trade the lesser value and riskier currencies you will need to use something like Bittrex.  My understanding is these coins can only be purchased with BTC or ETH. 

Scams are everywhere, do your research and look at multiple sites. The info is scattered and generally opinion based. I have come to the conclusion if a lot of people are really down on something or claiming it is a scam you should have a red flag go up. The market is still quite small and not every coin is a great idea. 

As far as trading goes I myself am just waiting for approval with my exchange to get started. Basically everything is tied to BTC. As it rises and falls so do many of the others. You seem to have a pretty firm grasp on trading so I will just remind you to remember that since you are using BTC to get other currencies like VTC, BAT, ARK, NEO, etc you always need to be mindful of the price of BTC when you are trading. 

My basic plan is step one, hope the market dips after the 30th when some of this China stuff takes another term. Purchase BTC or ETH based on how much they drop. Wait for whichever one you purchased to make a recovery and then use some of your BTC wealth to purchase a straggler that you think might be due for a serious bump. This is why research into projects and teams will be important. Lots of examples of things exploding and falling in short periods of time. 

Eventually things get more complicated with ICOs, atomic swaps and all sorts of madness but I do not know a lot about that stuff. It all flows through BTC though so I would look into the price of that and decide where you are comfortable buying.

2062,"The issue here is that when you sell, you're taking a loss on your investment, meaning that you have ""extra"" to make up compared to a scenario where you had just bought in at the lower price.

My strategy is to hold what I have invested at higher amounts until they are profitable, but still buy in a little more as I can during the drops. This way, when the market reaches back to where I bought in at first, I haven't lost anything from the original investment and the lower buy-ins have made profit.

This relies, of course, on the assumption that the market will recover. If the market NEVER recovers, than selling and buying in lower is the better strategy. I'm most recently bought in at ETH at 280, so I'm pretty sure it'll bounce back to that eventually.

It's all a gamble, but if you're pretty sure the coins will regain the value they had when you bought in, don't sell the original coins.

EDIT: Also, if you mis-time your sell/buy cycle, you'll end up a) taking a loss from the original investment and b) missing the chance to buy back in low. This market is EXTREMELY UNPREDICTABLE!

Thus, if XYZ coin has a niche function, good tech, solid backing, and has the marketing to get itself out there and it's only got 25mil in market Cap at the moment it represents a far more volatile opportunity to ""moon"" you to a 10x return (250mil market cap) everybody dreams of because it lucked into the right partnership with Google and atomic swaps with my belt buckle.

A coin with a small market cap ($NAV, for example) @ $50m market cap only needs **$50m** in new capital to DOUBLE in price. Compare it to something bloated like $NEO @ $1b market cap, where it needs **$1b** in new capital to double in price.

In this example, we really only need a little over 10k BTCs to enter the market for $NAV to double. If $NAV is any good, and it attracts the attention of some big whales who decide collectively to throw thousands of BTCs at it, it doubles very easily in price.

Let's say NAV pumps out some good news at the same time with NEO. Assuming the news are both of ""equivalent"" magnitude (say listing in a new exchange), NAV will almost be guaranteed to see a much bigger jump.

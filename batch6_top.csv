1,"Hey there, I'm seeking quality shilling and criticisms of my choices.

Currently HODLing VTC (bought in at $1.3 early in the week). Probably gonna set my sell order at $3.3, and buy order at <$3.75. I need to diversify a bit though, and was looking into expanding my HODL to BCC. Groestl and Walton both have ugly names, but look kind of promising IMO. I didn't buy link, but perhaps it's undervalued currently. I've followed ETH since launch, but have lost faith in it's platform and I'm not fond of coins built on top of it, but am open to being persuaded.


I like the technology of XMR and Zcash, but don't trust the devs from either (cuz floffy pony in the former, and devs reward in the latter). Is there any up and coming solid privacy coin you know of?

36,"Why metal (rank 35 on coinmarketcap based on speculation) is going up

Metal is an payment application for your phone which makes it easy to use cryptocurrencies at in certain industries and also helps with the everyday usage and the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Because bitcoin is already here for more than eight years and still it is very difficult to use a lot of bitcoin, so metal who wants to solve that with integrating this payment system in certain industries. There is an incentive to use the metal app, because you can earn up to 5% MTL on every purchase. 

If you want to do a payment to a small company that accepts metal  and you pay for example 100 dollars in bitcoin, he accepts it over the metal app and you can earn 5% of your total money. 

Several trends, mobile application instead of computer banking
They use cryptocurrencies instead of money so these are already two very important trends. The third one,  they use their payment application in very specific industries which have difficulties in using payment applications in general. Market potential for unbanked industry is worth billions of dollars. There are numbers of industries that face problems accepting credit card payments, so some industries have a high risk profile and have difficulties with accepting credit card payments because banks don’t trust them enough and metal is wanted to solve that because some of these target markets they have are really worth billions of dollars.

Target markets: Nutriceuticals which are worth 75 billion dollars in the US. Cannabis is right now almost 7 billion dollars in 2016, that is up 30% from 2050 and this is projected to grow with still double – digit numbers every year. The eSports industry is also  a very fast  growing industry with an estimated word of 175 million for 2016 and that is an increase 43 percent 2015. So basically they are aiming at high risk profile target markets. These markets are all growing very fast and right now we come tot he point why metals should go up the next few weeks and months. 

This is easy, metal is right now  almost worth 176 million , but it is purely based on speculation there is not an app application of something  out yet. So this is totally speculation on what is going on and on 30 october metal is going  to release its alpha version of its application. 

So finally this speculation of the last few month is becoming reality very soon. That is completely huge, this will push the price so much higher than it is right know. 
Second imported thing is that it will also be integrated on the ledger hardware wallets. If an cryptocurrency is being  integrated in the ledger hardware wallets then it always goes up. Two important things at one time, first all of this speculation can be coming true with this alpha release of the payment application and the integration on the ledger nano hardware wallet so these two things makes me believe that metal is going to up actually pretty much over the next few weeks and next few months.

Also why does bitcoin keep doing these forks (my understanding is that it majority big miner driven as a money maker) personally I feel Bitcoin was the first so obviously it’s the greatest coin but these forks seem to devalue and potentially be what makes bitcoin less valuable and legitimact than even some of the smaller alt coins.

The team has a lot of experience with cryptocurrencies with several team members having worked in the industry before and some of the team members also have experience with financial and payment companies particularly visa.

I am convinced of the potential of metal. Great concept, strong team and a solid plan to grow their user-base.

Feedback needed! Only on Ropsten testnet now, do not send mainnet Ether.

How to use:  

* Simply choose a winner among BTC, ETH and LTC for a fixed 12 hour period (00:00:00 Friday to 00:12:00 Friday, 27 Oct 2017 UTC).

* Enter the amount you are willing to bet (only Ropsten Ether) from a browser with Metamask extension, or Mist.

* A deployed open source Ethereum smart contract will control the funds, calculate the best performing Cryptocurrency (with bet lock and bet close prices) and prepare reward for the winning users to collect.

* Parimutuel Betting: Winning pool takes everything from the total pool after a fee (Takeout 5%)

* Price fetched from Coinmarketcap.com API through Oraclize.it at the beginning and end of the bet period

Bet on a favorite to easily win a small payout because it only needs to beat lesser opponents. Alternatively, bet on an underdog and win a huge payout. Tip: Use the Odds. Questions and feedback are welcome.",0.9933,daily_general_discussion_october_26_2017,0.0,0.76,0.24

Also which do you consider to be the most hypeable coins.

1) could it disrupt

2) how big will the disruption be

3) how many things will it disrupt

4) public exposure

5) appeal to human desires. in this case greed

I'm new to crypto so I may have also just completely mismanaged my money. I was wondering if somebody could tell me what I may have done wrong since I'm still very new to trading.    
    


Basically, I wanted to trade some ETH for REQ on idex. So I made an idex wallet, sent ETH from myEtherWallet to my idex address. The money appeared on my idex wallet instantly. Cool, so I ""deposited"" my eth to idex, then used about a third of it to purchase some REQ. The rest of the eth I then wanted to ""withdraw"" back in to my wallet. So, I click the ""withdraw"" button, withdraw all of it from idex back in to my idex wallet. I even got a confirmation message saying the withdraw had completed. It is also reflected in my balance history. So then I go query my wallet... and POOF, the eth has completely vanished. I lost .339 eth this way... which is only about a hundred bucks... so I guess it's not the end of the world if I lost it. Also, the purchase for the REQ is safely in my wallet. But still .... what could I have done to be more secure? I only had my eth deposited in idex for about 5 minutes. Did someone steal from me? Did I do something wrong? I keep paper copies of both the myEtherWallet and the idex wallet private keys. I know, they say you shouldn't keep your money on online wallets... but my money disappeared while deposited to idex? Don't you inevitably have to just trust that exchanges won't lose your money? IDK maybe idex is just a sketchy exchange.
 &nbsp;
&nbsp;

304,"Man I got into crypto fairly recently, and I just want out already. I put ~4k in, and I'm up about 2k and expect to go higher, but fuck me everyone in this community is just so god damn annoying and toxic. I hope I can get to a point where I pay off some school loans and then I'm leaving this subreddit and crypto for good. It's doomed to fail.

This is what you're looking at.

First, the people that control the market the most are millionaires who simply got lucky. If anyone thinks that most people that had BTC when it exploded calculated that shit, please, most people bought it thinking it was a gimmick and got it for fun because it was cheap. That was the impression I got back then, that was the impression I get now. So we don't have necessarily mature/intelligent individuals that built their fortune based on smart and calculated decisions that understand the ramifications of their actions, that pump and dumps, buy walls, sell walls, all these different things(which from my understanding is illegal in regulated markets), they pretty much destroy the confidence of credible individuals and companies in what crypto is and can be. Nope we have literal children controlling the market.

It's starting to be taken serious by some big names, but for the most part it's still seen as very immature, very raw, and this is a big reason why, you can't stop these things in crypto so the market is too volatile for any *real* investor to get involved with.

Wait real investor? What do I mean by that? Well the second part of the community is largely comprised of *children trying to become millionaires* on sub 1k investments, and when they don't get their way they cry like children. It creates this outrageously toxic atmosphere where everyone is shilling their coin and talking down all other coins, so to the outside world all coins look like shit. And wanna know something? They're not wrong.

We don't know how the fuck any of this is going to work. Billions are being invested on *theory*. Like what a joke, right? 99.9% of alt coins can not be used anywhere, yet every asshole wants to tell you their coin is the coin of the future and is going to blow everyone away. Fuck off with that shit, bitcoin is the only one that can actually be used to purchase things, and even that is incredibly limited, and often the limitations are only in shady areas(gambling/drugs).

Basically, this entire thing, while it isn't a scam, it isn't actual investments either. I feel like we're not investing based on what will actually be useful, but we're just mass gambling vs. each other. Who can convince the other side that their side is better, then they pull them over, make some money off their gamble. The funniest part is ultimately it doesn't even matter because you got cunts that influence the market in enormous and unfair ways that is illegal for a reason in regulated markets.

When people say this is a bubble? They are *very* correct. This shit is going to pop and a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money. I just pray that I'm able to get out by then.",-0.9545,daily_general_discussion_october_23_2017,0.147,0.72,0.133

2) Bitcoin starts rising and people trade out of alts dropping those markets 

3) Bitcoin reaches new heights and then reddit and FOMO buyers join the market.

All the following has happened pre-fork.

4) Bitcoin deflates post fork because the coins have already been duplicated.

5) The fork shitcoin crashes and people trade into alts.

6) With the excitement off bitcoin, alts start inflating from their deep lows. 

7) every goes alt crazy, hype bubbles pop, newbies get burnt.

Unlike existing crypto loan facilitators, SALT is the first to require collateral from loan applicants before granting a loan.    
From their FAQs:

> If a borrower misses a payment, our Secured Automated Lending Technology automatically liquidates a portion of the total collateral to cover both the missed payment and any associated fees. If a borrower continues to miss payments, the collateral will continue to be liquidated to cover monthly payments of principal, interest and fees until the loan-to-value ratio exceeds a predetermined threshold. 

The SALT token has an actual function; 1 SALT = 1 membership into the SALT platform.  This means the value of the SALT token is a function of the demand for access to their loans:

> Each SALT is representative of a membership to the SALT Lending Platform. The token is an ERC20 smart contract.

379,"**The following is a quick announcement about how Particl (PART) if succesfully adopted could potentially increase the value of all cryptocurrencies:**

**Can users only use PART tokens to transact?**

**Short answer:** No. Not quite.

**Detailed answer:** If we understand that Particl is a modular smart contract platform with the decentralised, privacy centric marketplace being the first module to launch then the following responses make more sense:

- The aim is for the marketplace module to have built-in shapeshift integration. This means any of the (currently 67) cryptocurrencies supported by shapeshift can be transferred to a particl client and automatically converted to the native PART token for transacting on the Particl network.

Furthermore the modular smart contract nature means other widgets and modules can be built to integrate other exchanges (both centralised and decentralised) and services into the Particl network and client e.g changelly integration for USDT:PART integration or widgets that connect direct fiat gateways.

Particl also utilises atomic swaps so any other chain which utilizes atomic swaps can directly interact with the Particl network to exchange/swap PART (foregoing exchanges altogether). Current candidates include LTC, DCR and BTC.

To this end its a misconception to think Particle only supports the PART token. It actually supports multiple cryptocurrencies via a mechanic that brings value to the PART token whilst providing a means to buy and sell goods anonymously using those cryptocurrencies.

...

**There are advantages to this approach:**

- For one it means Particl can simplify its user interface by driving all core transactions on the Particl network via the PART token.

- It makes the **Particl platform both a fiat/liquidity magnet as it provides non-speculative value to multiple cryptocurrencies** which are sent to it and acts as a liquidity generator since it creates the means for people to buy/sell goods with multiple cryptocurrencies.

As the Particl network grows **this would strengthen the links between cryptocurrency and fiat whilst simultaneously making cryptocurrency more independent of fiat.**

- This approach creates economic incentives to hold and promote the token and benefits holders as its value increases in a manner proportional to increasing non-speculative use on the Particl network.

- Contrast this with systems like syscoin where the native sys token is not essential to transact. It suffers from diminished speculator and thus network effects to propagate spread, promotion and usage of the native token and even if non-speculative use of the syscoin network increases this does necessarily translate to increased buy demand  on the sys token.

- The PART token is used to secure the Particl  network via PoS. Increased non speculative use of the PART token to transact leads to diversification of PART.

Those who set their clients to stake to earn a portion of the marketplace/transaction fees + staking rewards thus wind up increasing the node count and diversification which increases the security of the network.

- The PART token has a dual nature: A public token for where the added cost/verification time of transacting privately is not necessary and where accountability is a requirement (e.g. selling large volume, low cost, high frequency white-hat goods).

A large transaction pool is required to make the private ringCT transactions work. If multiple currencies were allowed to buy/sell goods directly (rather than be first converted to the native PART token), the pool of available transactions for RingCT would be diluted and thus the anonymity ringCT provides would be weakened.

...

Particl will provide a system where all the economic, network and pragmatic incentives of cryptocurrency are in perfect alignment, something which is not true of many other systems in cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology.

Perhaps the most important thing I haven't stated is that by integrating all the services it does and allowing for modular expansion under one privacy centric platform, **Particl provides convenience and streamlines existing processes for private, anonymous and public commerce independent of traditional fiat.**

...

**In summary cryptocurrencies that choose to integrate with the Particl platform will instantly find non-speculative uses and revenue. This will drive fiat into those cryptocurrencies, increasing both their liquidity and value as these will now be used to buy and sell goods on the Particl platform via its decentralised marketplace and any other services it offers.**",0.9928,daily_general_discussion_october_20_2017,0.019,0.888,0.093

I have TONNES questions and would really appreciate it if people could help out.

First I am low volume investor. Over the next 12 months I can afford to invest ~$5000 so here goes my questions...

#1) Why buy into high cap markets? 

Long HLOD on High cap markets doesn't seem to be worth it. If bitcoin EXPLODES to 1.9 trillion in 5 years thats only a 1000% return. When you're  only dropping $500-$1000 it just not that rewarding.  Seems like only sub 300mil markets have a chance of blowing up, and thus I should shotgun invest shining young stars and hope one blows up.

#2) What are the differences between ICO and non-ICO coin?

I understand that ICO presale coins basically to boost the value and build hype. Almost every ICO I have seen has been a bubble within the first month. Seems a lot of coins do this however regardless of ICO.

#3) Is there a worthwhole relations between 24h volume and market cap?

So Im looking for lowcap market coins being that I want a 10,000% return on investment. Two identical market caps but 1 has a 10% volume and another has a 0.01% volume. The latter is inactive and could indicate a dead coin. Then again... every coin is dead before it explodes... I suppose volume on low cap is the result of hype?

#4) is there any difference between mineable coins and non-mineable?

Something about non mineable coins seems off but I don't know much about it.

#5) What are your top 3 non reddit sites to talk about crypto?

And if buying into cryptocurreny is like buying stocks, what determines their value and price? What is it based on? In stocks, the price would be valued on the production of the company and PE ratio.

419,"**What does Particl have over Monero?**

**Short answer: Particl (PART) is a privacy platform whereas Monero (XMR) is a privacy coin.**

**Detailed answer:**

Monero is a decentralised currency that is currently reliant on centralised services for its use. **Thus in its practical implementation it is not fully decentralised** and there is a central point of failure when transacting.

In contrast under the Particl network and client listings, transactions, escrow services and settlement are fully integrated and decentralised; this includes:

- Network security where the nodes can be obfuscated via tor integration.

- Transactions security where the buyer, seller and amount can be obfuscated yet verified by RingCT.

- Seller security whereby the nature of listed items being sold can be made private and obfuscated to the rest of the Particl network and only viewable if the viewkey is disclosed (i.e. the seller discloses this via private communication to potential buyers).

- Communications security. The client nodes have the capacity for sending encrypted messages between each other allowing for truly private communications between individuals on the Particl network.

- Settlement security by providing a trustless third party free escrow service (the mutually assured destruction escrow) whereby both seller and buyer deposit a bond that can only be released when both sides agree goods/services have been delivered as specified.

...

Whilst Monero and other private currencies offer anonymous transaction security with the benefits of decentralisation, they do not provide the other forms of decentralised security I've just listed *which Particl and currently Particl alone proposes to*.

Yes decentralised marketplaces could accept monero *currency* but they would have to provide decentralised, trustless privacy centric escrow, communications and private listings to provide the same level of service and flexibility of selling/buying options that the Particl *platform* provides.

This is because in addition to what I've described Particl also enables anonymous or public settlement of public listings.

...

The biggest single threat to ecommerce is censorship either by the platform provider or by take down of the platform provider. We have seen multiple platforms that use XMR disappear and we have many documented instances of legitimate, legal commerce being censored by the platform provider for reasons that are often questionable at best. 

**The Particl network provides a resilient platform to protect against censorship.**

...

Perhaps the most important thing I haven't stated is that by integrating all the services it does and allowing for modular expansion under one privacy centric platform, **Particl provides convenience and streamlines existing processes for private, anonymous and public commerce independent of traditional fiat.**

...

**NB: I am bullish on XMR.** It had an incredible network effect going which has not been realised yet. I'd rather the XMR team understood the ethos behind Particl and looked for opportunities to collaborate in this instance as an XMR:PART integration would represent the ultimate in private tx for me.

**Addendum:** Before you vote on this, carefully consider the merit of what I'm saying and imagine what it would be like if such a system were to hypothetically exist regardless of who developed it. I'm aware of SAFEX and syscoin but if you know of any other platforms like Particl I am keen to hear about them.",0.9867,daily_general_discussion_october_19_2017,0.043,0.84,0.117

I'm thinking about starting an ICO for my own startup.
I already have a working iOS app and a registered US patent (US 9343053). 
https://www.soundinmotionapp.com/

TOKEN Model would be: 
Some will be sold on ICO, 
Some will go to devs that make audio plugins for the app
Some will go to composers that provide music & SFX for the app
Some will go to employees to incentives them. 

Token will be used to purchase content within the app itself or within the eco system (so one license will work for Android and iOS and Windows for example).
And also potentially to be used for content purchase at our partners (for example - we would make 'Waves Audio' our partner). 

I think I would do an ERC20 Token. 
Please check the website and the patent. 

I would probably wanna raise ~2M USD using Eth. 
With this sum I will definitely deliver upon all promises (more platforms, features, cloud supported eco system for tokens, etc). 

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

476,"**Time to draw attention to a very under the radar project with a large potential upside that will bring some interesting advances to cryptocurrency as a whole: Particl (PART)**

...

**Particl**

...

Particl is a PoS chain using the native PART token.

The purpose of a dedicated chain is for the privacy centric and optional anonymity aspects of it.

The PART token can either be transferred as a public token or as a private token via use of CT and RingCT to obscure sender and amount.

The PART token also confers voting rights proportional to stake of network owned for the onchain governance and voting mechanisms.

There is also a MAD escrow service they are building in; a trustless escrow system which requires no third party. Using only the native PART token simplifies this mechanic.

It is for these reasons and the simple economics of incentivisation that all currencies fed into particl will be converted to native PART token via integrated shapeshift function prior to use on the particl network.

Particl is a modular framework and yes smart contracts mechanisms are involved on the bitcoin core codebase it uses. Their use of ringCT and focus on truly trustless privacy and anonymity is partly why they avoided ETH but also wish to sidestep any possible scalability issues present in ETH currently or bloat issues of launching a highly focused but intensive product. I'm sure there's a bit of ego to prove their coding chops too.

**The first major module they plan to launch in Q1 2018 is the decentralised marketplace and communications platform**.

This marketplace will allow for:

- Public and private listings of goods for sale (private listings only viewable if the key is known), 

- RingCT to facilitate truly private transactions but also a public token to facilitate non-anonymous one's.

- Encrypted end to end messaging including group messaging.

- Filters and categorisation systems to help find goods.

- Automated shapeshift integration to automatically convert multiple the 67 and growing cryptocurrencies currently supported by shapeshift into PART for transacting on the Particl network.

- Modularity allowing for widgets and other tools to be built in and plugged into the particl network providing an interface to link other decentralized exchanges and tools to the main marketplace as well as the particl ecosystem.

- Atomic swaps (like LTC and DCR) to allow frictionless transfers and conversions of tokens.

On minimum viable product release (Q1 2018) the marketplace should be essentially complete in the sense of publicly usable minus the reputation systems they plan to implement after.

https://particl.wiki/articles-about-particl

I believe Particl if realised as designed will impact ecommerce massively on a paradigm shifting level. Simply put commerce without borders and a massive boon for sensitive transactions.

I am ignoring all price activity for now. The project will not use it's funds to needlessly hype and will likely deliver the marketplace minimum viable product in Q1 2018 to justify it and silence all critics. 

This is because the team (which is now greatly expanded and actually funded) have been heavily criticised for not delivering in the past (as the much smaller, unfunded SDC prior to setting up their foundation) in spite of the history showing clear development (actually rapid for a project of this nature) and currently meeting all milestones given.

From a speculative point of view there are numerous reasons to preferentially invest in Particl:

- Holding tokens confers true stakeholder ownership of the network, 

- Receipt of transaction fees proportional to stake and number of transactions on the network. 

- Receipt of interest but with decreasing annual inflation rate (5% PA year one to flat 2% year 4 onwards) to facilitate early adoption. 

- Limited token supply with significant lockup due to PoS. When marketplace is launched if used, the buy demand on PART will be massive relative to circulating supply even for small scale use of the marketplace which should drive up the price of PART massively.

If Particl is successful then I believe it will be a literal juggernaut in the making as far as use cases, speculative returns and technology advances in crypto go.

Im very new to this crypto world but everyday im learning more.

Is there a way to sell your cryptocurrency and change it to euros and get it on your “fiat” bank without sending your ID or pasport information etc?? 

For example im holding euros in gatehub by selling xrp. How do I get the euros on my “real” bank? They ask for my pasport and im afraid of identity theft and all.

And I’m hoping my story might help few at least one or two new crypto investors.


I bought LINK tokens couple of weeks ago and after doing my own research about the potential of this token and having understood the problems LINK trying to solve. I really believe in Sergey Nazarov and I’ve watched so many interviews of him and I think he is a genuine guy. 

Then yesterday I was just monitoring the price movements of LINK while lying on my bed and trying to recover from bad flu. And I came across this tweet from fake Sergey Nazarov twitter account and I just believed it must be true and that was my gut feeling or may be I’m very sick. And when I check the price of the LINK token and it was little bit down and I was like it must be because of this AIRDROP. 

Then I just reacted and only thing in my mind was getting hold of some free LINK tokens from the AIRDROP.
￼

Withdraw my 12,216 LINK Tokens from  Binance Exchange Ether address
https://ethplorer.io/address/0x3f5ce5fbfe3e9af3971dd833d26ba9b5c936f0be

I created this MyEtherwallet address with intention of getting my free AIRDROP LINK tokens according the twitter scam which linked to this website http://linksmartcontract.com/blog/

then I transferred my 12K LINK tokens and 0.2 ETHER into below MyEtherwallet address from my BInance exchange account 

https://ethplorer.io/address/0x53737a5963f464201f5f55f650061d64a094a03b

up until now everything was fine Its my ether address and I was holding the private key. Then I went to above website put in the details to see how much free LINK tokens I’ll be getting. And I saw this 3664 free LINK tokens and I was super excited and I think my brain is switched off for few seconds and….


￼


Then on the next page I put my private key clicked continue.. 


￼
Yes I gave my private keys to this scammer and few minutes later I checked my account to see if I get my free LINK tokens..

And show zero balance on my account and I lost my all LINK tokens. 


The thief got my tokens and transferred to the below accounts…

https://ethplorer.io/address/0xf5572f804ba88a4c869641f020351cf73941cc91

https://ethplorer.io/address/0xdb37036d615e20dee825fcc6e8384517cee44321

And Now all my LINK tokens and ETHER sitting in the address above. 


I hope this scammer needed this money more than I do and I’ll make much money in Crypto genuinely, but I would not steal somebody’s money.

I've been watching the price of triggers spike and come down since they burned 70m coins, although I didn't except to see the price drop to where is currently sits (currently at time of writing $.41). Let me share why.

I think the Blocksafe blockchain has some real world potential. Recording when and where a gun was fired with shotspot sensors, I thought this might be very useful for monitoring police/military activity, whether its misuse, friendly fire or they are in dire need of backup and can't call for help. It may also help deter people from using guns if they knew it was being recorded. https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/blocksafe/

Apparently Kevin Barnes has confirmed that the Chicago Police Department will be piloting blocksafes tech, but can't find it anywhere other that this link....http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/3511441#ixzz4vTX2smAD (Only thing else is this tweet...https://twitter.com/blocksafe/status/914128116393676800). But link does mention that Blocksafe will be featured at the Defense Strategies Institute’s Summit in November where attendees will include NASA, USAF, and Homeland Security. So I believe they are getting in front of the right people

I finnaly decided to switch from Bittrex to Binance. So i registered on Binance 3 days ago and looked at this site a few minutes ago. Tried to feel comftable with everything so i started klicking everything on bincance to look how it works. Well i pressed the support button and cant explain myself the following:

You know ""Andre"" the Evil Hoodlum from the Game Rayman Hoodlum Havoc? I used him as Avatar on my very very old Steam Account years ago. This Steam Account got hacked by a filthy russian about 2 years ago. Nevermind, already used another Steam Account for a very long time then. Ofc im using now another Email-Adress and another password. Only my Avatarname stayed the same (its not rathuban).

So i got onto the supportside of Binance and saw the same Avatar next to my name.  Andre the Hoodlum.... On the original Binance-site I have an empty Avatar-Slot. Its only when i click on the Binance-Support Button.

The Binanceaccount was only 3-Times used... as I logged in. I checked the history. Its only my own IP-Adress

Im really shitting my pants how this could be.... I doubt this is concidence.... Nether Steam nor binance required the Avatarname for a login, so i cant be hacked on Binance.


tl:dr:
registered on Binance. As i clicked the supportbutton on Binance i saw the same Avatar picture as my hacked Steam-account 2 years ago. Ofc im using different Emailadress and different Password since then. Avatarname stayed the same. Shitting my pants now how this could be.

Edit:
i found the solution. i was also using this avatar on battlelog from battlefield. battlelog and the support site of binance are using gravatar. this result in the same picture",-0.9753,daily_general_discussion_october_13_2017,0.117,0.843,0.039

The coin has been so battered that I doubt it has much downside (if the news is disappointing) - and of course any positive news could be particularly profitable  (because the coin is coming off *such* a low base price - because it's forgotten and/or hated).

The AMA is useful because it allows the crypto community to ask the key question directly to the horses mouth: **what intrinsic value does NMR have** ..the fact that Craib is a mathematician managing a hedge fund means he knows exactly how it should be valued  (based on how he plans to position it within the fund now that he's had time to decide & set up the structures) ..I.e. any bullshit ""I don't know"" is a red flag while more likely he will finally be able to answer the question.

As a businessman **he is incentivised to make NMR valuable** (to attract good talent) so I expect he may have some interesting news.

861,"Hi all,
was looking at AirSwap and reading from the whitepaper: https://swap.tech/whitepaper/ . Wondering if someone here has some knowledge about few questions below.

1. It seems makers do not publish their price. So if there are 10000 makers indexed, the taker has to ask all the 10000 about their price.
For example, taker wants to buy 10 X for 20 Y. Now it has to ask all the makers and find the ones that sell 1 X at 2 Y. That makes it quite inefficient, isn't it?

2. Who can be indexer and who can be oracle? Can any node be an indexer? If yes, what's the synchronization protocol.

3. The expiration on the order will make things quite slow. The taker fills the order, and waits and possibly the maker can cancel the order. Not only you have to wait for the ethereum transaction to be consolidated, but even the expiration time. How is that going to work?

4. Am I right or it cannot be used to exchange currency of other blockchains? Because to me, exchanging only tokens in ethereum doesn't seem extremely useful. If instead there was an exchange protocol for other currencies, using ethereum as contract platform and ether used for fees, that would THE trading platform. Instead, this is just an ethereum token trading platform, meh.

5) I have all my crypto in 3 exchanges currently. Bittrex, Binance and Quadrigacx. If I was too late to get to a hardware wallet do you think they will issue whatever forks from Bitcoin?

Meanwhile, risk aversion is retreating as headlines are no longer dominated by North Korean threats. There is some degree of geopolitical risk left owing to the Catalan elections and the attack in Las Vegas, but these don’t seem enough to drive investors strongly towards digital gold or bitcoin.

If miners pick up a work items (or is it a full block?) from the pool do they get a set timeout period to work on it before other miners pick it up and work on it, or can other faster miners also pick it up and beat you to processing it. If so then faster miners will always squeeze you out. If in a mining pool, i guess the combined power of the pool allow you to win the race sometimes Thanks
Update - just read up about the nonce etc and how to do a valid hash (usually withing 10 mins) And yes, faster ones have a somewhat better chance of winning, but slower systems can win a reasonable number of times if they 'get lucky' (and if they use a different 'starting point' for their iterations -- which they will anyway as will be using their own unique transaction? address)
And where do the bitcoins (12.5 bitcoins now) for that block 'come from' or 'live'? Do they somehow link to that block , and if the new owner spends them .1 btc at a time, do 125 new transactions somehow link to that block?

2 - What if I create a wallet on a web based solution where I have access to my private key and then the website closes? Can I use my keys somewhere else?

I have learnt a lot about cryptocurrency from people using poloniex but I have been seeing a lot of people having problems with that exchange, could someone elaborate?

2) One of the things I still do not understand is this: Imagine I was trading in cryptocurrency and I had a few good trades. I started off with 0.01 BTC and after a couple of trades 24 hours went by and now I have 0.02 BTC ( after fees ). I now want to convert my BTC back to euros.
But the BTC is less worth at this time than at the time I made my conversion from EUR to BTC since this coin itsself is a cryptocurrency. Now all that trading that I have been doing essentially evaporated because its less worth. Does this mean I have to always check the BTC/EUR rate before converting or do I not need to worry about this since BTC is pretty stable?

- Merchant payment gateway. Token holders get 50% of fees from merchants. More than 100 merchants already signed up and accepting payments through them
- Huge team with Rune Evensen at the helm

Negatives:

- <$1M market cap: tiny 
- low volume: ~$150,000/day 
- only traded on 3 exchanges, one of which is its own exchange
- too ambitious--being a ""one-stop-shop"" for crypto???

Regarding all the ICOs and Cryptocurrencies. What would grab your attention and would make you use some source on a daily basis? 

We run a listing website, but it's too simple, we have some ideas in mind, tell us what you think, and maybe give your own suggestions:

- Instead of listing ALL ICOs we would sift out the shady ones, perhaps make a whole new table just for shady/scammy looking ICOs, and leave good ICOs on the main page.

- List only those ICOs who have a complete whitepaper, a product (Beta version, or trial, or service), a full and reputable team, clear roadmap.

- Write reviews and/or in-depth analysis of ICOs, let people decide whether to invest into said ICO or not. 

- Prepare Infographics. This is something that has been on my mind for some time. 
 * Infographics about the status of ICOs (Monthly updates, how many ICO started and closed in that month, total amount raised and general, technical things)
 * Infographics about reviewed ICOs (Condensed and easy to read information, showing only what would be necessary for the reader)
 * Infographics about Investment level into a said ICO

- Maybe sometime in the future - video reviews.

I know that there are a lot of ICOs that are not reputable or trustworthy and it might seem that all ICOs are like that, but I want to sift out the best (as much as I can). No shilling, no trolling.

* I tried using the monero Gui and downloading the raw blockchain since syncing took ages. Whilst downloading the raw file, it failed on me around 17gb. Should I simply try again? Or is there a better wallet that you'd advise using instead?

* The 3 exchanges I've seen mentioned most are coinbase/gdax, kraken and bittrex. How safe are these and can I let some currency linger on these, or is it best to immediately transfer to wallets.

* I'm now using Exodus, coinomi and the monero Gui, and will probably have to find additional wallets for Nimiq and waltons, are there any wallets you'd advise against?

It seems like the value of the coin going up doesn't affect the unit of action (I just made up that term) that the coin represents. Votes shouldn't get more expensive - it's just a blockchain technology but the coin is being traded. What gives? Are all of those sort of like proof of stake so the coin holders get coins for helping maintain the network? But even then why would that coin that gets mined from maintaining the network be worth anything? The purpose is to keep track of the votes, not hold value.

How robust is the Coinbase trading platform? Both on PC and iOS? I cannot customize the charts on the iOS app from the looks of it. No volume, no indicators, no ability to markup, etc. 


If I don’t want to buy one ~$4,000 bitcoin can I purchase a “partial” bitcoin? Let’s say I wanted to buy $500 to start, is that even possible? How so? I read about a lot of teenage noobs buying bitcoin but it’s hard to believe they are buy multiple bitcoins at ~$4000 each. 


What is the standard bitcoin ticker symbol? I use TD Ameritrade for my stocks, options, forex, etc. I’m wondering if I’m able to purchase bitcoin via TDA, or an accurate ETN/ETF that reflects the bitcoin price. Does bitcoin have legitimate derivatives? Options and futures? Not bullshit like “binary options.”


Is there a good resource for basic beginner bitcoin/crypto lessons (preferably video) that relate the concepts to regular stock/forex trading?

-Whats the real cheapest way to buy large amount of crypto anywhere in the world?
-Should i make them invest and hold for 2 or 3 coins, and ask a percentage of the earning they make from that?
-get them to invest in big mining rigs work with that and get my profits from a % of the crypto mined?

I understand that there might be people that would just tell me do your own research, the thing is i already did researched but i would love to hear opinions from the community.

1246,"Say you are okay with a roommate or two.

Find a room in a house for rent. Bonus point for a bedroom and private bathroom. 

Then consider all expenses. 

For this we're in the USA.

Monthly expenses:

$750 rent everything included.

$100 food

$50 other

$900 a month / $10,800 a year.

How about you're not a total bum so a car and car insurance. $120 / month

Maybe you kinda like the outside world. $35 / month hotspot for phone.

You could get by off $13,000 / year. We know things happen so lets say $15,000 a year minimum. 

Lets say every year that goes up $1,000

15k + 16k + 17k + 18k + 19k + 20k (2022 you basically need to take home $20,000 a year to get by comfortably alone) = So lets say right now $100,000 saved up will get you by 5 years so by 2022 you will need to have come up with some more money. 

Basically I'm trying to figure out how much money I need saved up to retire. I have at least 30 more years judging by family history. Could be 40 max most likely. 

Most likely will need to make $1,000,000 between now and death. I have a good starting point. My goal is to trade crypto coins to a million dollars in 40 years. Wait for next time the big coins start pumping. Jump from coin to coin. Eventually have enough money for 5-10 years. Perhaps buy a coin and wait get lucky in that it goes up a ton. Have 20 years worth of money. Then just hold a coin and over the years it just continues up and I have 40+ years worth of money. 

You can even go anywhere in the world that has cheap living and unload BTC for local currency to get by. Cost of living much lower in a nice area? 

Like trade some of the shitter coins that are easier to pump. Then end up piling all money into BTC and ETH. They double or triple and boom a million dollars. 

I mean if you have 5-10 years worth of money you can just sell $1000 every 3 weeks. You should be able to make $1000 in 3 weeks trading. Then have a 5-10 year buffer in case you don't make a trade for a few months. 

Even just holding a few coins over time they should be averaging more than $1000 profit every 3 weeks. So you can pretty much just sit on your ass and not even trade.

I get that mistakes will be made but I see crypto as something that is going to be up and down for a couple more years until governments and business are more serious about trying to control its wealth.

Anyways, my long term plan is to invest in some low cost/higher risk currencies with my initial capital of 500-1000.

It emphasizes smart properties over smart contracts, claiming the distinction is like that between a class and a method in coding.

Current market cap is 34 million. The white paper came off as intelligent but sloppy. Many English errors, in addition to several typos.

My conclusion: not a scam, but not very intriguing. Small market cap gives it some upside, but I wouldn't hold long term unless there are more developments.

1346,"I'm having trouble using Blockfolio. I have yet to find an answer to this question that I'm satisfied with. 

My pattern for buying crypto currencies is usually something like: 
1. Buy bitcoins using USD
2. Transfer bitcoins to an exchange and trade the bitcoins for altcoin X

Now, what I'm trying to figure out is -- How do I properly track this on Blockfolio?

The first two steps are obvious: 

1. Enter a transaction, BTC / USD and enter the quantity that I purchased and the price at which I purchased in USD.
2. Enter a transaction, AltcoinX / USD and enter the quantity of the altcoin that I purchased and the price at which I purchased in BTC. 

Now, my Total Portfolio Value on Blockfolio not only includes the value of my altcoins, but the value of my bitcoins that I traded as well, inflating my portfolio value. They are being counted even though I traded them. 

What is usually suggested to me is to make a sell transaction in the BTC / USD with the amount that I traded for Altcoin X. I haven't been able to get a proper advice about what I should set for the transaction price in USD. I hate this suggestion because I didn't sell BTC for USD. I traded the BTC for an altcoin. Is there any proper way for this to be recorded in Blockfolio? If that's the case, is there a website that I can just manually enter how many coins I have and track their current value without having to bother entering incorrect transactions?

I have made all my purchases mostly on looking through threads on here. Bad I know! I should not listen to some random dude on here trying to get his or 'coin of the day' pumped.

Now I have being been buying like a mad man. I started 100% BTC around ten days ago. I now have 45% BTC. I got lucky with my first trade picking up a big chunk of LTE at Â£170. Then a big lot of NEO and XRP before they jumped. I also got some IOTA, ARK, WAVES, RND, POWER. I also have small amounts of VEN, TRX, ADA and CND.

I have my eye on some XRB and some Siacoin. I really feel I need to just stop now and think about what the hell am I doing. I originally just planned on buying BTC and holding and just getting a bit of ETH and BTCC but I have gone crazy! I feel this alt coin world has a lot of potential so I want to really learn what I'm actually doing! Any advice on what to do with what I have so far?

Alt surge (based off news and speculation). This most recent surge I'm guessing is really based off speculation. Now a significant portion of these profits from this surge will likely be pushed into BTC as futures on CME will launch driving the price of BTC up and alts down. When BTC stabilizes, those profits get dumped back into alts so on and so forth.

People will argue that the recent surge is based off new investors coming to crypto. I find it hard to believe a coin like ADA and XVG spiked in price based off new investors. I hold both and love profit but let's get real. Furthermore, new investors in the cryptospace will be investing in BTC and ETH or LTC. Not in unpopular coins initially.

It's really great feeling to participate in this crypto revolution :)

Couple days ago my wife gave 50$ to invest (I didn't know the market so we didn't want to lose all money).
I made some rookie mistakes like exchanging fiat to bitcoin and exchanging btc between markets - after that I had 26 $ ;D. Right now I have 32$! I have an agreement with my wife that if I will have 50$ at the end of the yeah I can invest more money!

I'm bothered by the fact that noobs constantly talk about market cap rankings yet pay no attention to the fact that it's easily manipulated by supply.

I know that any sustained increase in price is harder to maintain over the long term when there is hyperinflation or a massive base supply compared to average daily trading volume.

I know projects like this crop up every day and I'm almost tempted to release a coin with 100 billion supply and a $2 spot price with <$10 daily trading volume just to stress my point.

I'd probably become rich through by selling my stacks to noobs fomoing in though, and that daily volume would probably rise very fast...

Yet I see hype for certain projects that occupy top 50 positions with questionable long term value.

My portfolio has been doing well but it sucks to see a certain token not ranking higher even though it's fundamentally a top 10 project in my eyes.

If it's base supply was 10x higher it would probably be a top 10 coin right now. I know for a fact it would be top 20 on that premise looking at its recent trading activity.

412,"I personally think BAT will be one of the biggest gainers of 2018. People seem to write it off at first, but once they take a deep dive and do their own research they realize how brilliant of an idea it is. Not only that, I hang out in the community a lot, and I tend to see how many smart people affiliated and involved in the project. Not just low level discussion, its smart people who have ideas and provide great insight and think outside the box. Listening to  Bredan Eich's (brave ceo and creator of firefox) vision and roadmap for BAT is amazing. Just check out Boxminings interview with him.  

Anyway heres some highlights to look forward to for 2018

BAT (Basic Attention Token)

* Will most likely be the first ERC 20 token to be added to coinbase due to meeting 80% of the requirements for the Gdax framework.

* The Coinbase CEO (brian armstrong) tweeted about it saying he would like it on their platform see https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/847521348918296576

* The coin has a real use case with integration in the Brave Browser that has  over a 1.5 million users on android alone, not including desktop or IOS. plus integration with youtube and twich, and twitter coming soon.

* Ad trials in 2018, and partnership with Duck Duck Go promoting web privacy initiatives and experiments.

* Low market cap coin, easy x5. Especially when dumb crypto investors see the potential and real use case. Smart money has been slowly accumulating per Etherscan.

* Check out the USD graph of BAT on coinmarket cap (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/)

467,"2nd edit: Is there a sub for crypto portfolio critiques (I don't see one on sidebar) or is the daily thread the best place?

Request for critique... here's how I'd buy if I had $1k right now. I should be able to put that much into crypto over the next 5-6 weeks. Obviously some prices will change so that may slightly affect the plan. I haven't accounted for fees in that $1000 total. I already have some Ark (enough for now), a few Neos and VTC, and a lil' bit of the Coinbase 3. 

Disclaimer, my understanding of crypto is still quite naive and I can't exactly articulate why I plan to buy these and in the amounts planned except generally I want to put more into the most solid or the most promising cryptos. I've only done a quick scan for most of them, where I'm basically guessing if the concept has promise and whether the website / whitepaper / etc is obviously garbage (usually not).

edit: What I hope you find interesting is that I include %age of total planned buy, and the fraction of circulating that I would own for each token (why vs. total? really no reason, I wasn't paying attention to the difference at first lol), which unfortunately for you does include what I already own for 5 of the 29.

I woke up today with an idea I want to share. Hope someone with crypto knowledge can tell me if it's bullshit or genious.

Nowadays cryptocurrencies are no real currencies but more like assets. They are too volatile to be used to buy groceries and so on.

So we know all the disadvantages of cryptocurrencies. But what if there would be a coin which value is always equal to a ""real"" currency like for example Euro. So it wouldn't be too volatile.

But how?
The value of a cryptocurrency is determined by all of us together. The good ol game of supply and demand. 

But what if each coin is backed up by a real â¬ or $? Like at a virtual central bank. 

People would buy their coins there, use them to buy stuff and whoever has this coin in their wallet can be sure that it's always exchangable for real $/â¬ at the virtual central bank.

Am I wrong or wouldn't this be a cryptocurrency you could finaly use as a currency?

651,"My total investment is on or around 20 USD. My initial plan was to HODL for life, but I realized I am missing out on some profit by not having a trading capital. Based on what I've been reading, the ideal situation is to have a HODL wallet, and a safe amount of BTC for trading.

Considering my very meager capital (I am a student who just got in a month ago), at what financial point should I start playing around with trading with alts? I've been reading on the various premises, and I'm eager to try it out, but as it stands, the tx fees (transferring from exchange to Binance/Bittrexx wallet) will eat up 80% of my capital. I'm also not based in the US, so Coinbase/GDAX is not my first option.

Should I wait until I have bigger capital? If so, how much is the recommended before I start putting funds in my ""trade wallet?""

Just bought some 0.016 Bitcoins a couple days ago, while Ripple and ETH were having their ATH.

* 1 - As I saw those altcoins going up and up, I decided to trade some bitcoins for them and then they started falling in price. Lesson learned: DonÂ´t buy in ATH, right? 

* 2 - In the FUD of the moment I panicked and traded my ETH back into bitcoin at a loss.

* 3 - Then I was live seeing the $17,250 barrier get eaten, when suddenly the BTC price was going down fast and Ripple price shooting up...in the FOMO and scared that BTC was dropping I traded all my BTC for Ripple and just as the transcation completed, Ripple dropped a lot and ended up trading around half of my Ripple for BTC at a loss....again.

* So now I have like 0.007 BTC and 132 Ripple. IÂ´m thinking I should stop day trading and just HODL.
In order to recover my 0.016 BTC, I would need to trade my 132 Ripple for BTC at a price of 0.0000624 BTC per Ripple...which seems like way up there in JupiterÂ´s ass.

* The question is: Should I never trade a at a loss again, and thus HODL my Ripples until they shoot up to 0.0000624 BTC?? How feasible is it for Ripple to get up to that price and in what timeframe?? Or should I just trade my Ripples now for about 0.000043 BTC per Ripple because BTC keeps going up and up,  and in the long run I will lose more if HODL my Ripples?

I've decided instead of putting all of my current investment money into our Roth IRAs ($500 or so per month), I want to take a portion of that (probably $150-$200 per month), and start dollar cost averaging into the big 3 coins and some alts.

Do I have the right idea?

* Load coinbase with USD
* On a weekly or bi-weekly basis, transfer USD from Coinbase to GDAX
* Buy Bitcoin, ETH, LTC on GDAX and then transfer to wallet (need to order a Ledger)
* For altcoins, transfer USD to ETH on GDAX, then move the ETH from GDAX to Binance and buy alts, then transfer those to wallet

I don't want to get into obsessing about small fluctuations, mostly just looking to systematically get money into this market...It's an amount that I can afford to lose, but a decent enough amount that I could see some substantial gains if things take off....If this all comes crashing down I'm out a few grand that would just be somewhat safe in the Roth, but invested aggressively, so who knows...

723,"Just curious, what's your ultimate exit strategy? Here's the few I've come across these last few months.

1) The ""HODL 'til I die"" philosophy, which is either just hyperbolic or just plain stupid, unless your main goal is to pass your crypto onto your children.

2) The ""when my shoeshine boy starts giving me trading tips"" philosophy (ie: how Joe Kennedy avoided the stock market crash of 1929). This seems to be a popular exit strategy, and we don't seem too far from this scenario. Right now, the ""shoeshine boy"" is figuring out how to buy crypto, but it seems only a matter of months/weeks/days before he starts giving tips.

3) The ""bitcoin is the future"" philosophy. This crowd believes BTC will become the global currency of choice, replacing the USD/Euro/Yen. This seems more popular among the libertarian-ish crowd that believes nothing has changed since the market manipulation by the Fed/Wall Street that led to the 2008 housing crisis. I personally find it unlikely that BTC will become the lingua franca of currencies, no more than gold is.

HST: Interesting project, low cap, but unsure how the project will work if the tokens become pricey. Also suspicious that 80% of the tokens are held by one address.

QC: Considering solely based on YC.

OMG: seems like a solid project with long term potential, but already at a pretty high cap.

CND: Well priced

WTC: Pretty excited for this one, I think itâs the perfect use of blockchain tech and has HUGE potential for future growth and applications.

WABI: Based purely on the hype and Alibaba rumors, not super sold since it already went ~5x ICO price.

1. Holding LSK/BTC. I can sell for either btc or eth. If I expect btc to rise should I sell for that to compound the gain?

2. If you spot a coin that's in the same boring channel yet swings very predictably between the same lows and highs if you sell at the top and buy lower is this good if your trading pair (btc in this case) stays stagnant?

3. When would selling your alt coin at a high but then btc falls and you have less to buy that alt coin with?
is it better to have units or a lower cost basis? Let's say I have WTC. I can try to accumulate more units of wtc now that it's higher but Ill instantly lose the lower cost basis. Which is better? Having a 10 units of a coin you bought at $5 or having 15 units but the cost basis is now $8

753,"Hi, essentially, I would like to set up my portfolio a bit better. I started off with only ETH, and I would like to diversify and in some ways hedge against BTC. I personally have a bearish outlook on BTC, but I see that some money can be made holding it from all these hard forks (scam fork or not). So, option 1 is to buy some BTC and hold for the purpose of appreciation and forked coins. One strategy Iâve read about is to trade altcoins, to increase your BTC holdings overtime, this would help get my feet wet for both btc and alts, but itâs a lot more active work than Iâd like right now. In comparison, I think more money could be made with alternative cryptos in the same time period, especially if it has fundamentally good tech, ideas, and usage behind it. So, no Iâm not looking for pump and dump schemes. Some of the alts Iâve been looking at are Vertcoin, IOTA, Litecoin, BCH, BTG, and Monero.

I would speculate that the likelyhood of crypto crashing in 2018 is about equal to the stock market crashing before 2022.

What are your predictions for the scenario that the stock market crashes before crypto? On the one hand it is possible that many will attempt to cash out if we face a full blown depression to pay the bills etc but on the other hand it is possible that big money will be looking for new asset class to park itself.

1002,"Hi all,

I was hoping to write a post, but I need some sweet karma first. So I'll leave it here for now. 

So I'm one of the recent noobs starting to get into crypto. I have been watching it forever, but never had the juevos to dive in. I bought my first $100 in BTC in September. When that turned into $200, I got in with $2000 more BTC, $400 ETH, and $100 LTC. Now I want to really get going.



I fully understand the extreme risk behind investing in crypto right now. The money I am looking to invest is not required for living my normal life. I'm looking to spread $20,000 total (including that amount I'm already HODL'ing). If it turns into $0 next month, I'll be mad, but it won't ruin me.



That being said, I wanted help with ideas on where to put it all. My original idea was the following (feel free to offer a different spread if you'd like):



$10000 BTC



$2500 ETH



$2500 LTC



$1000 of 5 different Alt-Coins



I want to set this all up this week, then HODL it until at least next December. If I come out on top, sweet. I'll use it to buy something nice/pay of my car/pay off my mortgage (moon-shot, not expecting this). If it all burns to rubble, then I'll move on to something else to invest in next year. 



So if you are in love with a specific Alt-Coin, shill your heart out. If you have a specific trader/app/wallet you love, please let me know. 



Questions? Ask them.



Bitconnect? Fuck them. 



Seriously, don't try to pass that ponzi scheme off as investing. Throwing in $50k and pocketing ~$500/day sounded great, until I dug deeper to see that beautiful pyramid scheme for what it is.

I visited this subreddit for the first time. Saw some comments about Stellar Lumens.

Out of curiousity, visited that site. It felt familiar. Then I remembered, I has signed a Bitcoin message to get free Lumens months ago. They were doing an airdrop of some sort for bitcoin holders. I had completely forgotten about that until I saw the website layout again.

Searched around for the private keys in my notes and Google Keep. Since I thought this was useless, did not really keep it safe. I found the signed message on Google Keep. It contained the address starting with G. I tried to enter that but it was not a private key. 

Then, looked around on a notepad file I keep on my computer where I just keep on adding random shit and found the private key.

I had 4100 Lumens! Around $720 lying around. And luckily, Ledger supports this so I transferred it to the Ledger.

Anyways, thanks to this subreddit,  I found something that made me a little bit richer.

I have mostly been following r/ethtrader but recently started looking into this sub more. I have entered the space in June by buying ETH, bought some of the dip in July, and have since started with alts.

I came across ARK here and it seems promising, good community, interesting tech (but I guess you guys already know that), but had never seen it mentioned in the Daily Altcoin Discussion in r/ethtrader (and they do discuss all kinds of alts, not just ERC20). Anyone know why this might be? Is it seen as competition to ETH, maybe? They explicitly state that they don't compete but interconnect different blockchains...

I got to thinking that while at Thanksgiving dinner last month, I am going to have family, who have absolutely 0 clue on anything about crypto or blockchains, asking about what blockchains are, and how they work, and how they benefit the world. Wanted to get everyone's opinion on if this demonstration would be an accurate ELI5 of blockchain technology.

Let's say you are at a dinner party with 20 people, and they are all watching you pour glasses of water for everyone at the party. You have one empty glass sitting on a table, and you begin to fill it with water. Each drip of this water is considered a ""transaction"". The more water you pour in, the more this glass fills up with more and more ""transactions"". Once the glass is completely full and can no longer hold water, place another glass directly next to the full glass, and begin pouring water into that. Repeat this process as more water (transactions) fills more glasses (block).

Now, say all 20 people (miners in this case) at the party are watching these pourings happen. They can all confirm that this water is, in fact, being poured. However, someone drops some milk in one of the glasses. One person (miner) notices that there is a drop of milk in a glass. If there is a consensus that there is milk (and not water) in this one glass, that milk (foreign transaction) should be removed to maintain the integrity of the glasses (blocks).

What do you all think? For simplicity purposes, each glass is represented as a ""block"", which stores 1 MB worth of transaction (or 8 oz of water in this case). Each drop of water is a transaction, and it allows others to understand how consensus, bad transactions, etc. can impact the blockchain.

Have at it, and let me know where I'm wrong.  Just wanted to think of something extremely simplistic to get people thinking about blockchain tech.",0.7096,daily_general_discussion_december_14_2017,0.053,0.878,0.069

My initial plan is to begin assembling a 12 GPU rig as my first miner. I won't be purchasing all the cards I finally, but over a fairly short amount of time. I'm doing this to allow myself time to acclimate myself to the whole process while also limiting my into all risk. The cards I'm going to purchase are gtx 1060 6gb.

My goal is have this rig pay itself off completely within about 6 months or so. At that point I'll use that money to buy a second one and hopefully continue scaling from there.

I have zero delusions of grandeur here. I know there's very little chance of me becoming a millionaire with crypto currency. However I would like to develop a passive form of income that coincides with my love for PC building and hardware, thus crypto mining. 

With all that said, how realistic are my goals? Any tips experienced miners could give me that I can't find in some article or YouTube video? Any pitfalls to avoid?

Like, I bought my first ethereum 4 days ago. Months before that I played ""pretend crypto investing"". Basically I lurked reddit, 4chan and some midsized forums, read crypto discussions and bet pretend money on altcoins that I thought had promising sounding rumors.

With my pretend money I mooned on 4 of the 6 coins I picked (IOTA, NEO, Monero, Stellar). There were also a bunch of others where I thought ""there's hype here, but it's worded full of red flags, so I'm going to acknowledge this coin's existence and consciously decide to reject it."" I followed their graphs and most of them didn't get anywhere.  

So I trust my nose for good altcoins. 

Say I put $50,000 USD into altcoins and half of them make it big like the ones I bet pretend money on. Where am I at then?

1317,"Getting my feet wet in cryptocurrency. Part because of the hype surrounding it, part because I regret not taking Bitcoin seriously or accepting it as a payment years and years ago (Dogecoin threw me off and convinced me this wasn't going to be a big thing). Looking to start small and not throw myself in the deep end. Basically my goal is to turn $100 into a profit. Whether that profit is $200, $300, $400 whatever. It's money I won't miss if I make poor decisions and I feel it's enough to have some fun with. 

I feel the easiest option to get into crypto is to sit on the BTC I buy. I think the volatile nature of the market is going to draw people to BTC given it's the leader and recongised coin, ensuring it only grows in the coming years; people don't really want to take risks on what they don't know. But for any worthwhile return, I'd need to invest hundreds, even thousands in 3-5 years time. 

I'm still wrapping my head around some stuff like exchanging and moving between different coins and what not but I feel I know enough to start making some moves. REQ and NEO seem the most attractive to me. REQ has a service that - if is successful - will keep growing substantially as cryptocurrency becomes more widely adopted (much of my belief is that crypto will become what the credit/debit card is). The hype around it seems well justified. NEO has a ton of hype around it and I haven't done AS much research into it, they seem set for a massive year in 2018 which could/should drive the price up.

**Basic pledge (aka ""HODL Weds""):** *Only check prices on ONCE A WEEK on Wednesdays!* Hourly or daily prices fluctuate, but week over week is generally very positive. Then when you load up livecoinwatch (or whatever you use), you'll see that BIG gain every Wednesday and have a BIG grin. :D

Advanced pledges: 
- Real /nofap - Fap only if you reach your gains! (say ""HODL nofap BTC $20k"" for example) . Alternate: You may substitute nofap with ""nocake"" or ""nobeer""
- HODL Monthly - check only on the first Weds of the month!
- HODL Annual - check only on New Year's eve! 

PSA: Crypto will change the worldâand it may change your lifeâbut it shouldn't control your life or cause you stress. Go out, live your life, check back once in awhile.

Midway through last year I invested only what I could afford in ETH and XRP and have not touched either, although I check them constantly and read this sub religiously. For a while I set myself a rule that I would only check crypto for 15 minutes once a week at 5 p.m. on a Friday night, but the rollercoaster has been too good to get off recently.

1573,"Are people just plain dumb?

Money has three core functions:

1) Store of value 
2) Measure of value 
3) Medium of exchange

USD/EUR clearly are measures of exchange (see everyday life), being backed by enough trust and state authority to have relatively stable value over time. Thus, they can also (to some extend) serve as measures and stores of value just because they work as medium of exchange.

Bitcoin is arguably not supposed to be money but rather a currency, with its main purpose being a measure of exchange. Thus, if you believe in Bitcoins success as currency, you should expect stabilizing exchange rates to an extend that makes Bitcoin useable as a medium of exchange. This seems optimistic and anyway, Bitcoin should not be an (or the best possible) investment case. If you belief the skyrocketing keeps going, you belief in its failure as currency and should expect the rates go down medium-term, as Bitcoin has no intrinsic value besides its function as currency.

Apparently, there was a time where people used Bitcoin as an exchange medium with good reasons (mostly on the dark net) and success. Investing in (opposed to using) it seems plain dumb, though, because youÂ´re betting on Bitcoin not working as currency, thus losing its value, no? Should be true for most other alt coins, but madness seems greatest with Bitcoin.

tl;dr: investing in Bitcoin seems irrational, because you`re betting on its failure as currency and should thus expect its value to fall medium-term",0.9677,daily_general_discussion_december_13_2017,0.108,0.703,0.189

1583,"For the past two years, I along with the dedication of a handful of colleagues have devoted the majority of my time to the creation,development, and (until 3 short weeks ago) deployment of a hardware that I have good reason to believe would have been a monumental step in medical technology within the next year. Data transfer is and has been the backbone of this project. This is where blockchain technology (Bitcoinâs gift to the technological world) came into play. For over a year, all development was based around this. Mid 2017, our research team found that the capabilities of a little known open source data transfer technology that was very similar to that of blockchain but far superior in many ways. A decision was made to scrap previous development and start 80 percent of what weâd poured our lives into for the past 18+ months and reconfigure the entire platform around this (remember this point) open source tech. We reached what I would consider final development stages a little over a month prior to this writing. Pre-launch events and branding have been scheduled and paid for, legal documentation in order, etc. What would most likely be a future multibillion dollar corporation with a noble goal was set to launch in 2018. This was all put to an immediate halt 3 weeks ago when our legal department was contacted by a very well known corporation that I (for unfair but good reason) am not allowed to name. We had been informed that the rights to an open source (remember that point?) string of data in our product was in the process of being acquired and until final documentation was in order, it was in our best interest to cooperate and cease any and all development or future press related to the product. We were also âaskedâ not to disclose any details to press, public, or even family. In the following days, we were given what was described to as but far from an option. We could continue development with the promise of a legal battle for our corporation that was founded entirely from day one within the boundaries of every legal and/or ethical guideline that exists, or we could agree to an acquisition by this corporation. We were presented with a non negotiable acquisition offer based on time and financed used over the course of the 6 months after which we implemented the open source (There it is again!) platform that I mentioned earlier in this writing. 6 months that represents in my opinion 20 percent of what I value at at least a 7 digit US Dollar figure worth of time and capitol. An option was given, but there is no option. If we push forward, there can be 2 outcomes. 1. We lose, and the minuscule offering for what is rightfully ours is no longer an âoption.â 2. We somehow âslayâ the Corporate Goliath. But here is where once again, a choice has no viable options. Either way, the corporation that myself and many others have pumped life into with our own finances and literal blood sweat and tears (some of them not caring one iota about financial gain) will be bled dry of capitol to the point that even a 20 percent buyout will be absorbed ten fold in the bankrupt shell weâd leave behind. Iâm not writing this to win the affection of the public or for financial gain. Iâm writing this anonymously because itâs only one story of dozens with the same exact punch line, and thereâs going to come a day when we truly realize that weâve given too much free reign to the money hungry corporate pirates that we are allowing to drain the future of this country and this world of our basic human rights.

Yesterday I finally got around to moving XRP to my nano ledger s, and converted some LTC to VTC and DASH. It is all so fun! 

I come from the r/financialindependence mindset, and had been focussing on increasing my contributions to my IRA and 401k... Since I've gotten to that point and had a little bit of discretionary income, I've been able to dollar cost average some money into coins.

I started with Coin Base's three coins, in August, witnessed the minor September increases, then the correction to previous prices in October. I HODL'd. November and December has been a hell of a ride.

I know every month isn't going to be 100% gains, but I like investing my ""play money"" so much more into the crypto space than on penny stocks or JNUG/AMD/whatever-WSB folks do.

I plan on doing further research and purchasing some Cardano (ADA), Zcash (ZEC), NEO,, Iota (MIOTA), OmiseGO (OMG), Iconomi (ICN), Ark (ARK), and Monero (XMR) in the upcoming months.

What exactly is the worth of crypto? Currently all I see is people investing to either just hold them in the long term, make short term profits or buy illegal stuff on the darknet. Doesn't look like a good premise to be a legit currency, feels like buying stocks without the performance of an actual company backing the worth.

On top of that I think the government is going to regulate this stuff heavily so you can't abuse it as easily for illegal actions.

It wouldn't make sense for them to sell all their coins peacefully into a bull-market. And let the market continue on an upward trend without them.

My theory is if I look at some coins that if you buy and then wait till it's 2% higher and then sell and then wait until it's at least 2% lower and then buy and then repeat that (which is possible because crypto's fluctuate that much) you can get about an 8% profit a day easily.  

Which means that if you invest 1000 dollar you'll have like a trillion dollar after a year. Ofcourse only if it doesn't crashes completely but because from what I've seen if you go for the small margins then you can usually be in and out in 15 minutes or something. And if you only do that there almost no risk that your wallet will have dissapeared over night. The transaction costs are also low enough to support this theory.

2010,"Iâm a crypto noob who currently has $100 in ETH. 

Really looking to put another $100 in either BTC, ETH, LTC. 

For BTC from what Iâve heard the pros are that itâs a relatively more stable and âprovenâ crypto and that it shouldnât tank as much. However 80% of the BYC have been mined already so it might be nearing its max value before a tank. 

For LTC there is x4 as times coins to be mined and itâs not anywhere as near its cap right now. This can mean more growth in the long run. However itâs not as big as the others and may experience big swings. 

For ETH itâs already pretty proven and capable on modern day technology. It also seems pretty stable and steadily going up. 

So basically for my next dip I want to put some more money in crypto, either $100 in one or $50/$50. 

Penny for your thoughts on the analysis and any suggestions to which is the best? Iâm looking for medium-long term growth. Planning to hold on to them until July/August at the earliest before I sell.

Essentially they are giving away small portions of alt coins in exchange for page views, the more people you get to sign up, the more coins you earn.

I challenge you to visit any crypto related website, news outlet or blog in the Blockchain space and find one which is not discussing Bitcoin price, potential bubble threats looming over the new investors rushing in with their âget rich or die tryingâ dream. Almost every crypto related debate in the industry today has two opposing sides arguing over the outcome of the recent BTC hype taking the world by storm. In reality, they are both right, with all the innovation and promising future in Blockchain technologies, history and human behavior tend to be pretty repetitive. The recent digital gold rush is very different than previous price hikes as the main participants are retail and soon to be institutional investors that entered the game for a quick buck and nothing else. And so, Bitcoin will see its ups and downs in the coming months ,yet, as opposed to early days when miners and large scale investors were in the game for the technology and disruption, the new moon kids playing with crypto will scare easily as soon as the market shows signs of weakness and the fall will be a hard one. This is not to indicate a crypto-armageddon is upon us, we are still bullish about Bitcoin, blockchain and related future implications. We are taking a slightly different stence, BTC is going up but the road will be extremely bumpy, hold tight.

Pretty new to this. I use CB to purchase BTC, and then Binance to trade for other currencies and keep them in there. Although I've downloaded a wallet, I don't plan on transferring any there as the total amount is low (<$1k). 

I'm using CryptoPort at the moment to keep a track, but is there any app I can use which knows what price I entered in and how much profit I've made? CP only lets you enter your total amount spent.

Thanks

It wouldn't make sense for them to sell all their coins peacefully into a bull-market. And let the market continue on an upward trend without them.

2550,"Altcoins are dead(?)

This is me thinking out loud, so feel free to shoot this down but...
...the last week has shown that on its recent massive ups and downs, bitcoin most of the time takes the rest of the market with it. So, until more exchanges allow a greater variety of ways to buy altcoins, e.g. with fiat or other altcoins, it's kind of pointless to throw money at them because they're more or less just following bitcoin and are more risky given the smaller networks, market caps and support. I suspect eventually this will change, but as long as most of the public thinks cryptocurrency means bitcoin, they're pretty much just a riskier bet on the direction of bitcoin at that moment.
Note: I'm talking top 100ish, below that it's a cluster@#%% and I don't pretend to know what ups and downs are going on.
Full disclosure: I used to have a portfolio straddling numerous coins and did alright on a few during some sudden climbs, but it was admittedly largely the luck of looking at coinmarketcap and reading the mood at the right time. Now, just bitcoin because, for the moment, however good they may be on paper it seems pointless.

I see BTC rising over a decade and it's only rising due to being used for actual 'goods and services' (now it's being speculated the fuck out of but only off the back of being used practically for so long). Where does the value come from for ETH and Litecoin and other smaller alts? I've never seen any place that actually uses them as a payment method.

Theory regarding BTC and the ALT market...

So, when someone purchases an ALT this is the process they go through:

1) Buy BTC
2) Sell BTC for an ALT
3) Alt price is then marked to the value of the ALT in BTC terms it ultimately get the FIAT value.

But, surely in this process there is an imbalance. Let me explain, the gateway coin (BTC) receives the upward push in USD terms from the buyer, but never receives a downward push in USD terms when it's sold for an ALT.

At least in the stock market industry, there is some news associated with a rapid rise in the price.

First post so I would really appreciate some karma!

I was pleasantly surprised by the growth of BTC this year. More so upon opening my Electrum app and seeing I had some BTC, worth much more than I bought it for back in 11/15!! Thankfully I remembered the password.

While I sold some of the BTC, I am now fully caught back in crypto, after spending time researching (somewhat) and reading posts. I am now fully in the crypto-mania. 

I divested all my actual stocks this past year, so this is great to see, but mostly from a side gig/fun standpoint. I have just used some of the divested BTC to invest in other altcoins, so I am not spending current money. 

I find the tech fascinating and blockchains, especially like Ethereum based, is really the tech of the future. The possibilities are endless.

Right now, other than my BTC, 
I have about:
35% ETH
35% LTC
5% BCH
5% SALT
5% EMC2
5% IOTA
5% XMR
5% XRP

I know it is a lot, and I will be working to condense them down to about 5. A lot of exciting stuff for many industries though if implemented right.

Taxing and investing. Sorry if you guys get this a lot. 

Iâm new to crypto and using Coinbase. I have put a little money ($60 each) into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. 

My plan is just investing and from what I have been able to gather, as long as I donât move my coins, sell them, trade, or buy items with it, theirs no tax issue because Iâm not making any gains or losses. The act of simply buying currency with my own cash is fine. 

Two, if I do decide to sell anything, but wait for more than a year, the tax amount will be much lower than if I sell within a year (long term vs short). 

People have been telling me to try investing for years now but I never got around to it. Kept seeing folks in one of my groups talk about Crypto and decided to give it a shot. However before I start putting more money little by little into these accounts I just wanted to make sure of these questions. 

I realize some folks may ridicule me or something. Hopefully a few will be nice and give me a yes or no. I AM reading and studying, but I just wanted to make sure on these two points and have come to reddit before to ask things.

They have a link to the pdf about what it is and how it will work on their site if you are curious.

Basically you set coins aside for a certain time frame (that's the Deposit) and get a piece of mining rewards once that time is up.  There is no way to get access to the coins until the set time is up. The more you Deposit the more Weight the Deposit holds, working similarly to a Pos coin but Deposits have nothing to do with transactions confirmations and the wallet does not need to be left open once the Deposit is made.

Kind of a cool idea that has not been done like this before.  I've been mining them and looking to test out a Deposit once it goes live.  Could be cool.  

Either way it's new coin with a schema to lock coins out of the market like Master Nod and Pos coins but in a new manner, so that's cool.

Finally, today I decided to take some real steps towards becoming a trader. 

So I did some theoretical trading on a spreadsheet today. Everything went really well so I have a few questions to understand what are the limitations to crypto trading.

But first, my results:
To check cryptocurrencies and prices, I used coinmarketcap.com.
I started off with theoretical $5000.
After 11 hours and 32 transactions(everything on spreadsheet) I had $11872. So that's 137% profit.


Now of course I realise that conditions that I had were not real.
I would like to know what kind of limitations should I put on my theoretical trading to make it as real as possible.
A few questions that are unanswered in my head:

Is it actually possible to buy and sell all cryptocurrencies that are listed in coinmarketcap.com?

How big percentage (estimate) can I expect to lose on transaction fees?

How long does a transaction actually take? For example, a coin I bought  gained about 150% profit in 1 hour after buying. I sold it. Is that a situation that happen in real trading?

If market cap and transaction volume of a currency are very low, do my transactions have a visible effect on the price of it? For example market cap is $40000 and volume for last 24 hours is $500 and then I buy $500 worth of that coin)

Does most alternative coin trades happen between bitcoin and the alternative coin? Or is it mainly dollars?

I apologize for being so all over the place. My head is a bit in the clouds but I would really like to be brought down to earth and understand why my 137% in 12 hours is impossible to achieve in realistic situation.

Also I would like to start again tomorrow, taking all the limitations set by repliers into account.

2883,"Before I get torn a new asshole and raped with downvotes;  please hear me out. That's all I ask; and if you're not interested no harm no foul. I'm currently selling 0.05 BTC at $1,300 on eBay at item # 253304997190.

I recently found out my girlfriend is pregnant hence I need to go all out on getting her a Christmas present(s) because I'm gonna propose to her in cliche fashion during a New Years celebration.

I'm selling a portion of my BTC. https://www.ebay.com/itm/253304997190 ; verified and protected under ebay's policy. And for all you unfamiliar with eBay's policy; all sales made under classifieds DON'T offer the option of the buyer leaving feedback; so I can't get the brownie points for coins I already sold; although I can reveal the transactions if you'd like to see proof that I'm a man of my word by showing you two screenshots of the PayPal transaction ID along with my blockchain info. This should be sufficient evidence that I'm not fucking around. When people see no feedback or rating buyers become skeptical because I don't have 100% 5/5 next to my name for being such a ""good sport"" buying completely non crypto-related items. 

I never understood that anyway. Just because someone is reputable for buying/selling basic items; a fucking toaster and whatnot, how does that mean they can be relied on with crypto? Not to mention people buy stealth accounts (accounts with high selling limit and huge feedback) for as little as $50. So if i wanted to pull some shit I'd just buy one of those but having a big fat 0 next to my name isn't doing me any justice. 

I'm getting sick of eBay and other people jerking me around; I'm not a con, not a thief,  just a man who needs to do something special for his fiance for the holidays. Also nobody ever mentions the fact that it's illegal to sell crypto on eBay using auctions/listings under ANY other category; it can only be done in the classifieds. So the ones who do sell crypto under other categories and garner feedback are the ones who got lucky that eBay didn't screen their auctions and they managed to slip a listing or two past eBay tech support; which honestly makes no difference except for the opportunity for the buyer to leave feedback.  

So I don't have any fucking feedback because I have not used eBay since I used to sell gold from world of warcraft back when I was a teen. That was circa 2005. It's been inactive so long they removed my account and I had to make a new one. I do have references, proof, and whatever else you need to validate the sale. 

Once again I am selling 0.05 BTC at $1,300; which is MORE than reasonable. Unlike other listings; eBay only lets you sell crypto on the classifieds for a reason. It's for security & legal purposes, so that the transaction is monitored and no foul play occurs and everything goes smoothly. 

So before you say anything, let me cut you off for being a dumbass if you think this is a scam. Don't waste your time and mine. It's not. I couldn't scam you if I wanted to. Even after you pay, you can also reverse the transaction; whereas the bigger risk falls on the shoulders of the seller.

I simply want to sell a small amount of my BTC for a reasonable rate without the use of an exchange. People do it all the time. If you live in NYC region; I'd be happy to arrange a meet somewhere public in midtown Manhattan and we can conduct the sale in person over coffee/drinks.

Either way, I need cash quick or I'm starting 2018 single... Peace & love. Have a nice day.ï»¿ Thanks for your consideration. If you're not interested, please keep your opinion to yourself. I don't care for hostility.

Have a great day.

So I continued ""Because if it is that's worth about $15,000 dollars"". He and the target cashier who turned his attention to us both laughed at this point. I then asked the guy behind me (~50) if he had heard of crypto currencies and he said its too complicated for him and doesn't understand it at all. And the target cashier (~22) also had no cryptocurrencies and not much to say. So, I checked out making a few more jokes about it, explained the benefits of it from what I understand them to be, and then when I left I told them I'm going to start investing into it (as if I don't have a coinbase account already).

I opened two coinbase accounts, the first was via Santander where I was shown in my acct 2 sets of cents which I kept entering into coinbase for about 5 days, Santander told me that they were fine dealing with coinbase. Emails to coinbase, high volume weâll get back to you in a few days, huh. 
I then thought that maybe the problem was the fact that Santander has a four type login so, I closed that coinbase acct and opened 1 with my other bank which was just a name and password setup and, they accepted my check/debit acctâs YEAH or so I thought.

3005,"I'm Lawrence from one of the third world countries and this is my sad story. I first learned about bitcoin about 1 year ago after I lost some money participating in a ponzi scheme (MMM). I spent my time after that learning what blockchain and bitcoin was and even though I didn't understand the technical details of the tech I knew it was going to huge. I bought my first bitcoin in January through luno at $1000 and I kept it in my coinomi wallet. I started watching so many youtube videos and reading articles and I learnt I could transfer my btc to other exchanges to buy alts (that's where my problems started). I registered on btce.com and transferred my btc there and I started trading thinking I could multiply my money.

My first mistake was daytrading and my second at that time was calculating my returns in USD and not btc. Due to trading and fear I missed out on all the huge pumps and somehow I was up in USD but my BTC had reduced to 0.7 by march/april. I traded only on btce at that time and around march everybody was talking about PIVX and how great it was so i transferred my remaining btc to cryptopia and went all in PIVX which I bought at $2. some days later it crashed to $1 and stayed there for sometime. I waited for some weeks for it to go back up but it didn't and I decided to sell and about one week after I sold it went past my initial buying in price. I was mad and depressed. I moved my money back to btce and continued trading hoping for some luck and by this time all the coins had mooned. I was enjoying some decent profits when btce suddenly shutdown in july and my remaining $700 went with it. That's the day the world ended for me because believe it or not $700 is a lot of money in this part of the world.

I struggled for months to get back on my feet because I have three sisters to take care of who are all in school and I'm the breadwinner in my family. I worked harder than before and managed to save up $600 and in november I bought btc again. I really planned to HODL this time but then came the shills on reddit. I heard about confido and how it was the next best investment because they had an ICO with a $400,000 market cap. I transferred my money to kucoin when it dipped from $1 to $0.5 and I thought this is my chance to finally get in early on a good idea. I bought confido @ $0.5 with $400 and kept $200 in neo ( I was finally learning how to diversify. lol). I woke up one morning to hear that confido had legal issues and by then it was already too late as the coin had lost more than 80% of its value. I was hoping for a miracle and praying that the matter will be resolved and so could get out at a manageable price before they disabled all means of communication and it finally dawned on me it was a scam. Kucoin delisted confido and my $400 varnished again.

I have been depressed since 20th November and don't know if I will ever be fine. Sometimes I feel I have the worst luck in the world. I have stopped trading/investing for now and I have withdrawn my remaining to help my sister with her school books. I'm now working 16 hrs a day doing stupid jobs to try to get back up.

I'm sharing my story so that people will learn from my mistakes especially new people coming into this space. Crypto can make you alot of money if you invest in solid projects and are patient but you can also lose all your money as I have done.

lessons learnt are; 1. Do your own research 2. Never buy high out of FOMO. What goes up must come down 3. Have a diversified portfolio with solid projects 4. Avoid day trading. It messes with your emotions 5. Learn to HODL what you believe in 6. Never leave your money on exchanges 7. Get a hardware or offline wallet 8. Invest only what you can afford to lose because you might actually lose it

This is yet another proof to the fact that all the high level white papers out there are meaningless if the underlying technology is not fun, easy to use and solves a real pain point.

My question is: Now that BTC will be open to the massive manipulation of a futures market, where any huge whale can buy a bunch and then crash the futures side of the market--which will ultimately, as any derivative, be orders of magnitude greater than bitcoin-- how pairing will work?

I hate to put on a tinfoil hat and sound paranoid but I'm concerned that any fund like black rock who has 5.4 trillion in assets under management can simply throw a quick $50 million at btc. When the price rises by thousands of dollars in no time like we saw yesterday they can short take out a short futures contract and then dump the physical holdings at once right before expiration making the price crash. How will this affect alts when they pour the gains from this action into price debilitated alts? Will this delegitimize the space or call for further regulation? Will that regulation burdon the industry and lead to less innovation?

There is no official partnership, and it's like saying you're a ""partner"" of Microsoft/Google/Facebook for using their platform for your business. But it did go from $1 to $4 right after. 

On binance there is an extremely high volume compared to other alts. Problems withdrawing, which I get could be network congestion, but to me seem fishy considering it could also help prop up prices. 

The 5-15 minute trading volumes on binance also make the pump and dumps easily spottable.

Their forums are full of complaints that funds disappear - often, but not always they can be retrieved by shaking up addresses, connecting to different nodes, etc. - but not always. Then there's transaction taking literal days, and it's recommended to just re-send transactions every once in a while, try different nodes, etc. to get them pushed through, but that's not very effective either.

Basically, in terms of transactions, it appears to be performing much worse than even Bitcoin as far as speed and capacity is concerned. See also: https://thetangle.org/live . And the wallet/network's operation is so full of problems that things don't really appear to be under control. I know that there's talk of a spammer who may be clogging up the network, but if anyone can do this, then that's another big problem.

It seems to me that maybe they hacked their transaction graph stuff up without proper mathematical analysis of its properties, so they have lots of problems and it may not be clear whether this can ever really work properly. They're also using a centralized coordinator that has to sign off every transaction, after all. There was also that recent MIT crypto scandal.

I know that some analysis has been done by a math PhD, but in general this project is apparently mostly run by business people who are doing really well on the business side, but the technology side may not be keeping up.

Note that I'm open to investing in any new coin that looks promising, so I'm not ""hating"" on IOTA just because my stake is in other coins, but it just doesn't look good to me.

When I first bitcoin, the first thing I did was download coinbase, and buy some ETH and LTC too.

I think its safe to say that the 250 billion dollars that came into BTC in the past 2.5 months will eventually trickle down to use as well. Itll just take time.

Considering all the news going aroun USDT and the BTC futures going live next week, I believe exchanges might expect a crush of BTC and the only way I see to hide from it is to withdraw money to USDT. 

Given that there will be a huge demand for USDT at that point and not enough supply, could that crash the crypto market? hence the wallets on USDT are locked for ""maintenance"" ?

2. I understand bitcoin is at a high right now, but planning on long term holding, would you still say it's not too late to get in on this, or do you think it may dip a bit?

3244,"Hello! I am a mid term lurker of Ethereum. It seems to me that the edge Ethereum has over Bitcoin really is the tech (transaction speed/cost etc.). To me, the tech is more important than the price (very hyped), and I have been waiting for the day that people realize that Bitcoin is outdated and inflated. I was convinced that Bitcoin would cool off after 10K, but it just keeps growing due to what I assume is mainstream hype. Now to my question.

Bitcoin is slow now, yes, but always has the possibility to adapt and improve. If LN comes around and fixes BTCs arguably biggest issue: cost/speed, what is left for Ethereum? Bitcoin has the public opinion with it due to massive marketing. They have the brand recognition. It seems to me that Ethereum needs to do some proper marketing sooner or later. At this rate, if public opinion holds and tech improves, there will be no need to adopt anything else than Bitcoin.

3246,"Double edged sword - BTC futures are coming 

A lot of the recent BTC price action is attributed to the CME Bitcoin futures which will start trading in a few days time. For those of you who need some clarification; futures are essentially and obligation to buy or sell an asset (BTC in our case) at a later date for a certain price. 

Why is that important? Let's say that you mine Bitcoin and you want to make sure that you will be paid a certain price for your BTC, a simple solution would be to purchase a future today and lock-in the price for which you will sell your mined BTC. This would help you to be protected from market volatility. 

The average joe views this as a potential appreciation in BTC price over time as many institutional investors that couldn't buy BTC until now are suddenly able to do so. Yet, the other side of the equation signals caution to those of us who are familiar with futures market, as people might rush to sell their holdings and drive the price down. Simply put, if JP Morgan decide that BTC is overvalued and decide to purchase Sell futures, even Roger Ver will not be able to stop the price from trailing downwards. 

We are not claiming to predict a specific outcome, our stand is simple, when the sharks are coming into play you better learn to swim, fast! The Crypto markets are changing, change with them or get left behind. 

Make sure you use the best possible tools for making the right decisions in tomorrowâs market.

3251,"Hi.

I'm still new in this world. I don't even have any cryptocurrency yet, although I'm really exited about it's adoption. It will sure be the mainstream money at some point. I just have a major concern... Bitcoin as an example is deflationary, It's scarcity makes it perfect to store value (and perfect for speculation) so It's almost better to hold it instead of spend it, at least for now. A currency is valuable because you can trade value with it but... if nobody want to release their bitcoins, Why am I buying bitcoins anyway (apart from speculatory purposes)? I mean... most normal currencies have some inflation to ""encourage"" spending... The certainty that you can trade a currency if you want, and adquire goods with it, it's what makes it valuable.... right? If everyone is buying for speculation, and you have to pay more money to trade YOUR MONEY... I find it useless... I would like to hear someone with knowledge in this matter, just don't be irrational, I want to hear real thoughts about this. If you have articles about adoption escenary, I would be very grateful if you shared them.

All cryptocurrencies are deflationary? In the near future transactions are supposed to be much more small for mainstream trades, if cryptocurrency want to substitute cash you can't wait 10 minutes to confirm your transaction.",0.9851,daily_general_discussion_december_7_2017,0.006,0.828,0.166

3429,"Hi Reddit, my deep thought of the day! So the whole point of Satoshi Nakamoto's BTC was that their was a sustainable alternative to fiat currency right? But the major issue here is that we keep backing it against fiat! we keep checking how good it's doing against the USD for example, but really what needs to happen is that BTC should be backing all other forms of useful crypto assets and therefore help stabilise its own value while aiding other crypto currencies in their own right. So by spreading the value outwards like a true decentralised system. Effectively taking all the billions of dollars, pounds etc out of their economies and grow our own crypto economy from it. This would be the start of a true revolution. Ultimately we really need to see BTC flowing! and although it does, its flowing the wrong bloody way. My deep thought continues with the fact that many financial institutions such as FedRes, BankoEng, IMF and governments like US, China etc see this as a threat and even possibly to point of national security so it is in their upmost interest to destablise the crypto market before it can do serious harm. I wouldn't be at all surprised if they have gone to lengths to simulate these conditions and therfore know exactly how to break BTC. Take a dodgy government agency for example, it could use substantial dark money, the hoard of fiat capital obtained through illegal activities and government siezures to buy up large amounts of BTC and hyper inflate the price, just keep pumping this type of money in. After all it was untraceable to begin with. The hype on social media does the rest as more and more ordinary citizens rally for a piece. Then when it shows any sign of slowing down then pull out big! We have no idea how much influence these dark pools have and what they amount to either. To summarise then we could be either looking at the greatest technological revolution of our time, where the internet and crypto combined to create a new world stature with its own diverse economy. On the other hand and the way it seems to be going at the moment is that our greed is fuelling and indeed setting us all up for a heist of all heists.

I'm a not a US citizen, but I'm currently studying in the US. This has resulted in two problems:

1) Transferring funds into crypto. When I made a Coinbase account, I was able to transfer up to $400 per day. I verified my ID to increase this limit. Upon verification, Coinbase noted my citizenship and blocked further transfers as they 'don't support my country'. I have an account with an exchange back home, but I'd like to be able to transfer the USD that I'm earning from on-campus jobs here in the US. Can anyone suggest a trustworthy exchange that will let me do so? GDAX is linked to Coinbase (blocked there too), Kraken requires my ID (I suspect that the same will happen)...

2) Retrieving my money. I transferred my Eth to Binance to purchase some altcoins. When it's time to retrieve my money, how can I do so? Binance has a max withdrawal limit of 2 BTC (when unverified). If I make more than 2 BTC, is there a way for me to get my money out without having to wait multiple days? I don't trust Tether, so I'm not comfortable with converting it to USDT and doing a multi-day transfer process. I haven't verified with Binance because I'm worried that they will block me from making transfers too (my country is not often supported).",-0.9313,daily_general_discussion_december_7_2017,0.111,0.832,0.058

3630,"Long-time stock and option chart-based trader here:   Bitcoin upside price target of $25k seems rather inevitable at this point.   My only previous Reddit post on its price targets was in September that it was a great buy on pullback to $3.5k on the charts.  Pullback areas that look to be good entry points now are the $10k area, $7.5k, $5k and $3k.  

I was a huge skeptic on it years ago, argued about that on Reddit  -- jumped on board this year around $4k avg price -- the ease of opening account on coinbase was good for a gen xer like me.  An ETF on it is coming very soon which is a big positive, but also keep in mind that the futures type trading soon available will allow shorting, which can cause some big plunges and potentially increased volatility.

**Edit:**  I want to add a bit more to the pullback entry point levels mentioned above -- to some degree it depends on how far this current accelerated rally goes.  A 50% retracement is a very common (and logical) support area (and often a good entry point) after a pullback within an upmove (there are also other retracement and extension levels, see 'Fibonacci retracement lines' and 'Fibonacci extension lines' for those).  The basic/simple 50% retracement has worked well in the recent past on BTC, see my previous post on this in September -- in that case, I used the round $2k key low to the round $5k key high to come up with $3.5k entry point/support level.  Currently, I would put the round key low around $6k (could also be $5k or $8k depending on how you select it) -- so based on a theoretical/potential $13k key high and the $6 key low, a 50% retracement of that gain would be around $9.5k, which also is conveniently around the $10k round number (big round numbers are always psychologically important, and can act as 'magnets' at times).  Now, if BTC somehow goes straight up to, let's say $20k on this current near-parabolic very strong rally -- the 50% retracement at that point would be around $13k -- also on that kind of move you would prob want to be looking at the additional Fibonacci Retracement levels (and you can use Fibo Extensions levels for upside price targets as well).",0.9851,daily_general_discussion_december_6_2017,0.027,0.856,0.116

Granted you don't need to fully grasp cryptography and all the other technical wizardry that takes place, and can get by with a laymans/rudimentary understanding of how cryptocurrency works.

But I think even that gap in perception and understanding makes people very cautious: rightly they're risk averse, and won't put their hard earned fiat into something they think is too complicated, or beyond their knowledge.

So I'm interested in any potential coins, or other technologies that spin off the blockchain technology, that really reduce this gap: something that breaks it down so simply that it can convince someone risk averse to have a go.

Imagine if users were able to make crypto payments with the same nonchalance as when they whip out their phone and use Apple Pay, or login to their banking app using their fingerprint.

Are there any coins, or technology, out there that have this simplification of the end user experience as their stated goal?

I think this will be the next big thing, and a big big driver in getting the masses interested in getting involved",0.4515,daily_general_discussion_december_6_2017,0.058,0.874,0.068

I have a question for the more experienced HODLers here.
I currently hold Bitcoin in electrum wallet and some ETH and LTC on Coinbase / gdax.

I want to diversify my portfolio a little bit more and buy some Bitoin Cash, Vertcoin, Monero, Qash and Req. Maybe more in the future.

I got a kraken account set up,but for obvious reasons I don't wanna use that mess right now.

I am from europe (germany).
I want a marketplace that is secure, not involved in any scams that has a lot of coins to trade. 

Does something like that exist? If yes with which one did you make good experiences?

This is misleading. I search for any news content in Indonesian pers and I assume that this article is a response/translation from [the recent comment of Bank Indonesia governor](http://ekonomi.kompas.com/read/2017/11/29/180600526/bi-larang-fintech-dan-e-commerce-gunakan-bitcoin) who says

> Kami melarang penyelenggara tekfin dan e-commerce serta penyelenggara jasa sistem pembayaran menggunakan dan memproses virtual currency, serta bekerja sama dengan pihak-pihak yang memfasilitasi transaksi menggunakan virtual currency

Which translates to

> We [Indonesian governemnt] will prohibit any fintech startup, e-commerce, and any payment processor services who use/process any kinds of virtual currency or working with parties that facilitate transactions using virtual currency.

So **posessing** and trading bitcoin/cryptocurrency is ok, but legally we can't use them as currency.",0.5871,daily_general_discussion_december_4_2017,0.048,0.868,0.084

2- Real discussion, I honestly want to hear your thoughts.  Without further delay, on to the meat of the discussion.

At one point the author states: ""...But if Venezuela creates a cryptocurrency for which its central bank will hold a centralized ledger...""

I can't wrap my head around this.  I thought the whole point of cryptocurrency is that the ledger is NOT centralized, and that it is NOT governed by a single body.

Some of my favorite projects to learn about this past week have been IOTA, NEO, and ARK. In my opinion, having legitimate partnerships with huge companies like Microsoft not only shows that what they're promising has real value, but that they've convinced these tech giants and that's usually enough for me. 

I was first interested in MODUM, and while I still am, IOTA is a bit more ahead of the game right now in a broader IoT space). But ARK and NEO as coins that paid out were interesting (it makes their communities more involved from what I've seen), and their participation in hackathons are HUGE to me.

4066,"guys , a quick one,
been keeping an eye on the alts for sometime and I truly believe crypto in general and blockchain technology in particular  will be huge in the future (already is , but iam talking mainstream and not just btc) 

having said this , I also think that the recent mega bull run headed by btc over the last few months can be partially attributed to finex and their need to pump btc to cover up their credits (I know , conspiracy) but even if that's not the case , I think btc might take a hit and come down to ~4 or 5 k ,

not saying this will happen like now , but there is a very high chance this could happen in by atleast 2018 Q2 

so if and when btc crashes thanks to finex , do you reckon there will be a bear season of sorts ?....with huge discounts on all the fundamentally strong alts ? ( I think eth will also get taken down a peg or two coz of this ) .

 I will b honest , looking at an entry point into a couple of alts and iam not comfortable getting in  at the absolute peaK of a bull run (I know this could only be the start) 

anybody can chime in on this , and what do you guys feel generally , do you see the alts taking  a hit in the immediate future or do you think this bull run will last for a much longer time and In a way totally sustainable. ",0.9764,daily_general_discussion_december_4_2017,0.014,0.872,0.114

The more I look, the more I see people hearing what they want to hear, lumping more money into the market and ignoring or trashing the doubters.

There are problems with BTC. 

- Slow and expensive transactions, which leads to... 

- What I'm hearing about the fact that the BTC chain is fast being left behind technologically speaking by the newer, better functioning chains 

- What's being bought up is a notional asset (that's barely used as currency itself, despite that being its original intention) which sits on top of the real game changer, the chain itself (and we already know that the BTC chain is creaking under the weight).

I'm looking at history, at tulips, at dotcoms and subprimes. And at the fact that the first to market very rarely (if ever) ends up as the long-term winner, the winners are usually the ones who learn from the pioneers and do the same thing a lot better.

> Disclaimer: I choose to call it bitcoin breakfast, because it has the biggest name recognition. When I talk about bitcoin I mean bitcoin cash. However I picture this initiative to be a cooperation of all coins, as the fundamentals are the same. Different hosts can offer to introduce different cryptos. The guests can decide which event to join, which coin they want to learn about.
    
* 	Dezentralized open source project to spread crypto
* 	Host a breakfast, brunch or [enter your prefereed event] to introduce people to crypto

**Event Setup**

*	Guests find the nearest event on a website and sign up beforehand
*	Host prepares a paperwallet for each participant

**Event Schedule**

Sign in

* Guests arrive and pay their fee, host hands out their paper wallet (Fee-split should be transparent. How much goes to host, restaurant and paper wallet)
* Quick warning about keeping their key private

Introdution

* Explain private key, public key
* Explain paper wallet, mobile wallet
* Recommend mobile wallet for android, iOS
* Show how to swipe paper wallet

Breakfast

*	Enough time to eat,  swipe the wallet,
*	Host assist where necessary

Wrap-up

*	More info on crypo
*	Warn about risks like extreme volatility , device security and exchanges
*	Inform about some fundamental differences to fiat
*	Show possible routes to dive deaper into crypto
*	Pay the breakfast, ideally with crypot

**Phase zero**

* Create momemtum, spread the news, find people who can contribute
* Get some big exchange, site, angel on board / to support?
* Host your breakfast indepentently. You dont need not network, but please tell us about your success!
* Find contributors to a âbreakfast networkâ
* Github-repo, Domain
* Contribute Code!

**Phase one**

* Simple website
* Database where hosts can enter their events
* Event has info like: host, costs, duration, place (map), maximum guests and so on
* Guest can sign up

**Phase two**

Blockchain rating system:

* Event has a public bitcoin adress
* Guets can check host solvency
* Guests can sign their feedback, rating of the event with the key from their swiped paper wallet [a signed json?]

What do you think? Isn't this is an awesome way to spread crypto knowledge to the average Joe and destroy FUD? For the host it is a good opportunity to build a reputation. Let's build a true crypto-grassroot-network!",0.9918,daily_general_discussion_december_2_2017,0.054,0.811,0.135

I can't stop thinking about this given the current climate and BTC's bullishness, I feel in my gut that BTC correction is near.

I know historically they crash and burn even harder than BTC, but if they stay up in terms of USD, my satoshi stack would increase quite a bit.

Is it worth the gamble or would you exit alts (either to cash or BTC) if you felt something big was coming around Q1 2018? Just talking pure speculative strategy and theorycrafting here.

4603,"I didn't really follow this forum in early part of December so I was curious at what people were talking about during the first week of December in 2017.  It seems like two alts that were being ""shilled"" the most were REQ and IOTA during that time.  REQ was around 5 to 10 cents during that time so even with the drop, if you bought on the reddit shill during that time, you would have gained 5-10x with the current deflated price.  On the other hand, IOTA was at around 1-5 dollars during that time and was seen as a must for pretty much all portfolios.  Now, it is at 2.80(?) so if you bought at 5 dollars during the peak of IOTA shilling, fast forwarding around 2 months to 1/22/2018, you are still at around 60% of the mark.  

Just some interesting observation how caving to shilling can work to your favor in one case and not in the other. ",0.9467,daily_general_discussion_december_1_2017,0.012,0.872,0.116

I'm looking at a lot of alts and just after their most popular weeks, they start bleeding satoishis (doing worse than bitcoin). Neo, Req, Powr, Ark, VTC, and OMG all hae a downward trend vs bitcoin. Lisk and Wtc are staying relatively flat vs bitcoin. Good job Wtc and Lisk. They all obviously have some use otherwise no one would invest in them so you can't just say ""dyor"". I'm definitely missing a few more.  

Also in the event of a price crash many exchanges crashed, and many more disabled withdrawls.

I have a Ledger.

I would like to store more than 4 different types of cryptocurrency on it.

I have read that this is possible, except that I have to uninstall and reinstall the apps to access the wallets for each coin, if I have more than 4 different types.

Is this true?

If so, is it completely safe to uninstall the app, and keep many different types of coins, and then reinstall the app to send or receive?

I am trying to keep my investments as safe as possible, but I want to branch out into different types of crypto.

I am willing to purchase separate Ledgers if I need to.

I got really excited about it when I found it yesterday, because I think I'm heaps good at creating content and it seemed like a really intelligent use of blockchain technology... but digging into it today I've found a few examples of people thinking it's obviously a ponzi scheme, especially with the devs controlling and selling off most of the currency.

A lot of the info I've found is dated, so the whole platform might have run it's course and scammed everyone to be scammed, or it might actually be a good platform for good times.  No idea.

I made a post a bit earlier but I do not meet the posting criteria (understandably so, I broke the rules).  My question is this; a while ago I purchased IOTA on Bitfinex, I have been holding it on the exchange for a short while because I was not real familiar with the IOTA Wallet that was being tested.  

The other day I received a notice from Bitfinex stating that, as a US customer, I would need to move those funds as they would no longer be hosting US patrons.  I then created an account on Biance to transfer in the meantime.  It has now been ~6 hours and I have not seen the test transaction I sent to Biance (Only 4 IOTA coins).  Has anyone else had issues with a transaction of this type?

Also, I downloaded the recommended IOTA wallet, but I am receiving the notice ""Network error, could not connect to the remote node"".  Can someone give me a little help/advice?  It would be greatly appreciated.

This could range from a mild censorship attack which only censors to interfere with a few specific applications (eg. selectively censoring transactions in something like Raiden or the lightning network is a fairly easy way for a cartel to steal money) to an attack that blocks all transactions.""

Some crypto companies are trying to make the use of cryptocurrencies easier (for example trying to provide means for spending crypto either via cards, or online). Some examples could be TenX or Change Bank.

But today it is not easy to buy crypto in the first place. You have to chose between dozens of exchange, you have to have wallets, you have to enter your wallet adress correctly to buy and if you make a mistake your money is gone.

I can't imagine the average Joe bying cryptos in this current state, so it seems to me that mass adoption is not for tomorrow.
 
Imho it should be an issue crypto company should tackle but I haven't found any proposition on this.

You can buy stocks on margin, but usually to secure that ability you are still under some scrutiny from institutions before access to that margin is given.

In reality there is no ceiling for investment as even people who don't have any money can speculate and buy on credit hoping the increase in value will cover any interest on the credit card and provide gains as well. Thoughts relating to consumer debt and the growing crypto market? What if there is a correction/crash. All those people now have large  CC debt and nothing of worth in exchange.

I am relatively new to the crypto space, with low to moderate experience as a fiat investor.

I have holdings in the top market cap coins, which perform well, and I have invested in a few ICOs which may or may not bust.

My question is this, are the supposed Bitcoin forks legitimate?

I believe BCH is real, albeit controversial. I know the original BTC is of course legitimate.

What about Bitcoin Gold, Diamond, and Silver?

I have read in some places that they are scam ICOs meant to siphon your BTCs.

But, I have also read that they may be real, even though people seem to not like all of the forks.

Some say the source codes are privatized, and therefore this clearly indicates illegitimacy.

I would like to know the truth before I invest, please.

5511,"Hi guys, tried to make a post asking a couple questions but it was auto deleted because I'm new to reddit (I only made one because I got into crypto recently)

My post:

Hi everyone,

I am relatively new to crypto currency and reddit.

I am just trying to wrap my head around a couple of things and I am hoping someone can explain to me.

1) How does the project team for various coins pay there staff?

Many coins do not generate any form of income, I am guessing they use the funding from their ICO to do this, but what about when that funding runs out? I don't see mainstream adoption happening anytime in the next 5 years. How long can they continue paying there developers before they run out? What happens then?

2) this is about tether, I already know the crypto community has many concerns over tether. However there is one thing which doesn't make sense to me. Tether is a company. Companies need to pay there staff aswell. If each tether token is apparently redeemable/backed by 1$usd which they must hold in their reserves. Then how is tether paying there staff? Or how is tether suppose to make money as a business? Firstly the token will never change in value as it is tied to 1usd also they MUST hold a dollar for every tether. I see there purpose on exchanges but I don't see how they can make money as a company at all?

Can someone please give me some insight into this.

Thank you reddit crypto community!

If the btc network eventually expands to include one billion users, at 7 tps thatâs only enough bandwidth for one transaction per four and a half years per person.

5536,"In light of Thanksgiving and the holidays, I've taken time to reflect. I'm thankful for Ether.

One of the names for God is Jehovah Jireh. It means the LORD will provide. Of the innumerable things I have to be thankful for including family, friends, and community, I was specifically thankful for Ether over Thanksgiving.

In resigning from my job at the investment bank last year to pursue entrepreneurship, I had to take a leap of faith and let go of the security of a very comfortable salary down to no dependable source of income at all. To be transparent, I was pretty strongly on the end of the spectrum believing that God helps those who help themselves. This journey has moved me much further on the spectrum towards God providing to those that trust in Him. This experience has definitely given me the opportunity to trust God more that He will provide.

âWherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.â

Last year in August when I was getting ready to start my business, I invested $2,000 in Ether because of the vast potential I saw in cryptocurrencies and specifically the smart contract platform of Ether. At the time Ether was at $11.30, so I was able to buy 175 Ether. I thought of it as lost money that probably wouldnât come back.

What I didnât realize was that God was planning provision for me. I certainly am not wise enough to have timed the market just so, but in the following months, Ether proceeded to skyrocket from $11.30 to $50 by March. I was given total conviction to hold on. Beyond belief, it continued to skyrocket into June and hit a high of $400, making the original $2,000 worth $70,000. I still felt compelled not to sell. In July, Ether began crashing back down. On July 11th I felt like the only right thing to do was to buy more, so I bought another $2,000 worth at $186. Amazingly (and I know this is not out of my own intelligence), that was within days of the lowest price Ether has been at since then.

Ether began to march back up and almost hit $400 again at the very beginning of September, but then began crashing again. The only right move seemed to be that I needed to buy more, so I bought $1,000 more at $231, which again turned out to be the day of the lowest price Ether has seen since then. Now I KNOW I am not that smart.

But the final tidbit in this story to date and the impetus for this article is the other side of the trade. People have been sitting by on the sidelines warning of imminent disaster, telling investors âyouâre going to get burnedâ and âyouâre never going to get your money back.â

Well to my great surprise on Thanksgiving yesterday, I see a message from a friend hinting that Ether was performing very nicely. I checked and saw that Ether was up 15% on the day to $420 and felt that it was time to cash in some profit. A large part of that decision was for personal reasons, so donât read too much into what that might suggest about the outlook for Ether.

I transferred the proceeds out to my bank and can now say that I got my actual investment of $5,000 back and then some (and not just in unrealized paper profit). Not to mention I am still holding on to plenty more.

Like I said, I know it is not out of my own wisdom to have made those trades at almost the exact ideal times. And it certainly has been a step of faith to cultivate the vision of The Post Money Plan without a distinct source of income yet, but...

I know Jehovah Jireh.

You're looking at coins like Doge, Stellar, Ripple, even DigiByte going straight parabolic starting around May.

This continues through June while another 120MM Tether is printed that month and July slows down with only 80MM tether that month.

http://omnichest.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3MbYQMMmSkC3AgWkj9FMo5LsPTW1zBTwXL&page=1

In August all of the markets look to settle and consolidate as no new Tethers are printed that month.

Then in September another 120MM Tether is printed and boom you have you're next parabolic spike in the market, in coins like **Doge** ffs. 

You can't tell me people heard about Bitcoin in September and decided to move their money into fucking Doge, or Digibyte.

We're onto a slow October with no tethers printed until the 28th where we get another 25MM tethers printed to start off a hot November. 

220MM Tether have been printed this month and the market is booming across the board.

Seriously guys this cannot be a coincidence. Every time Tether is printed the market spikes exponentially. There's no way what we're seeing here is natural growth. 

You look at those charts in May and give me one good reason why a almost dead coin like Digibyte or a meme coin like Doge goes parabolic when they can only be found on Tether exchanges, please.

I'm curious as to what is the best course of action for purchasing crypto now? I see other users saying that its Coinbase, but in past experiences coinbase has had insane fees and pretty long processing times. Is there anything else you recommend for someone like me? Looking to purchase it, then transfer it directly to a wallet with the ability to quickly sell it if need be.

I ran into some old crypto that is now worth a decent amount which I'm hoping to use to kickstart my investments. I purchased a Ledger Nano S which I plan on using to store everything.

The situation with Bitfinex and Tethers is legitimate but it is a distraction. Inflated amount of Tethers are not a source of money used for Pump. Bitcoin is the source.
For some reason community accepted 20 Billion dollar appearance out of thin air which is the market capitalization of Bitcoin Cash as the natural process. It is not natural. These artificial money are currently used to cash out Chinese investors and pump original Bitcoin to 10000 USD without taking any losses.
Shortly after Bitcoin crash below 1000 USD they plan to introduce Bitcoin Cash as a true Bitcoin and necessary replacament which is not inflated and then reject Tether pairings. This is why Bitcoin Cash price is stabilized at 1000 USD as was price of original Bitcoin in January 2017.
This is the operation Dragonslayer in it's final stage. They have created billion of dollars with Bitcoin hardforks and use Tether as a tool to artificially bump Bitcoin price cash out their money and coordinate total collapse.
Please be careful as next month will be very *unstable""

DISCLAIMER:  I was just messaged this via text from a friend and colleague who I got into crypto about 8 months ago.  He has made a sizable chunk of change off his BTC/ETH investments and received this message in a private group hes a part of.  I CANNOT VERIFY THE VERACITY OF THIS CLAIM; I dont think any of us can.  But its worth sharing because thats what we are, a community of information sharers.  Id rather share it and people know about it and nothing happen, then the alternative.

How is this address different then a bank account number? With a bank account number, it is possible to gain access with small amounts of information and the bank account number, and perhaps even just the account number.

I read a lot about ""hodl""-ing, and my question is, do you believe that it is worth it to invest a sum of fiat into crypto, transfer it to a cold storage hardware wallet, and hodl it for 5-10+ years?

I have dabbled in stock and I understand that having a conservative approach in stocks is a tried and true investment strategy, set it and forget it, as they say.

But, with crypto being a relatively new financial asset, could it be possible that instead of appreciating in value, it could crash, or the top market cap crypto could be replaced by better, more efficient ones, and thus, become obsolete?

Just wondering because my plan is to keep buying and just hodl for about 7 years in a Ledger and then cash out to buy a house hopefully.

You're free to deny that this is a bubble, but by refusing to be open to this possibility your preparations will be weak.

I do, however, believe that Ethereum (among others) is gonna be like Amazon. And if you look at the AMZN stock chart, you can see that even if you bought at the top of the dotcom bubble in dec 1999, you'd still be up 10x today.

&nbsp;

...

&nbsp;

**So my accountant who doesn't know much about cryptocurrency emailed me today asking about it. He had the following questions:**

&nbsp;

- Isnât crypto currency actually more dangerous than fiat in that it has absolutely no intrinsic value and it is tied to electronic systems?

- Who are the major players, akin to banks today, the keepers of the money, who can be called upon by Sovereign bodies to provide information on transactions?

- Who guarantees the value of the currency?

- Are cryptocurrences convertible to sovereign currencies which still form the base of transactions and value exchange?

- What could happen when/if cryptocurrencies are the predominant means of exchange?

- How many crypto currencies do you think can co-exist?

&nbsp;

I realized these were the most common questions mainstream people have of cryptocurrency and decided to answer them. Feel free to read, learn and share with any newcomers asking questions about this space.

&nbsp;

**My responses:**

&nbsp;

- **I personally consider certain cryptocurrencies (not Bitcoin) to be a safer mid-long term investment than many stocks.**

&nbsp;

- **Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.** Cryptocurrencies are a type of distributed ledger technology. Distributed ledger technology is basically a ledger of transactions and records that is stored on multiple computers worldwide. These computers have identical copies of the ledger and their purpose is to continuously verify the contents of the ledger. They all do this simultaneously and must agree on the same final copy of the ledger for it to exist (otherwise it will split into two different ledgers; a process called forking).

&nbsp;

- There is usually an incentive mechanism in place to do this (and ensure consistency plus a singular ledger); often the computers process the ledger and are rewarded payouts in the form of that ledgers token.

&nbsp;

- In Bitcoin's case, Bitcoin is a ledger of send-receive transactions on the Bitcoin network conducted in the currency unit ""Bitcoin"" (BTC). There are computers which run specific software to verify the Bitcoin network and the probability of any computer processing the Bitcoin ledger receiving a payout in BTC is proportional to the effort that computer puts into verifying the network (relative to all other computers also processing the Bitcoin ledger). This process of generating and rewarding new Bitcoin is referred to as 'mining'.

&nbsp;

- Any computer globally can be setup to mine Bitcoin provided they download the software to do so and are willing to store a record of the Bitcoin ledger.

&nbsp;

- **As a result Bitcoin has no sovereign entity backing it.** It's distribution of mining is global (however there is a large concentration of computing power in China where large Bitcoin mining factories exist). Thus even though it has no sovereign backing, it can still represent a geopolitical interest. Bitcoin in this instance benefits China where it is mostly generated.

&nbsp;

- **Bitcoin is similar to gold** in that the vast majority of it's market cap is completely speculative. It is fair to say it has almost no intrinsic value. The appeal to it's proponents is that it can act as a form of digital gold. **The valuation of Bitcoin is mostly speculative** (I'd say 99%).

&nbsp;

- Because Bitcoin is a publicly viewable ledger, it is not anonymous or private (in spite of the misinformation out there). There are methods to obscure the transaction but these require third party solutions.

&nbsp;

- It was these third party solutions which were used by black market services such as the Silk Road (a dark web market) back in 2012 and 2013 which brought fiat currency into Bitcoin's ecosystem and raised it's fiat valuation.

&nbsp;

- As the value of Bitcoin rose, more companies started seeing the potential for speculative trading and non-speculative use of Bitcoin as a currency and took the plunge opening up websites and services which accepted fiat for conversion to Bitcoin (and increasingly now Ethereum and a handful of other cryptocurrencies). The increase in **these fiat-gateways acted as the liquidity and value provider for cryptocurrencies. They do not hold any purchased cryptocurrency unless you store it on them.** They are the closest thing to Banks.

&nbsp;

- You can either store Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) on a cryptocurrency website as described where it is held in their cryptocurrency wallet or you could transfer and store it in a private wallet.

&nbsp;

- Whilst it is true that Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies carry no significant intrinsic value, since 2015 we have seen the emergence of distributed ledger technology  beyond cryptocurrencies are really platforms with specific purposes that whilst still currently mainly speculative will likely evolve to carry real significant intrinsic value.

&nbsp;

- I've written two entire series of articles on the subject. Of relevance are these articles:

    * https://np.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/699l95/the_intelligent_investors_guide_to_cryptocurrency/

    * https://np.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/7d67qy/the_intelligent_investors_guide_to_particl_part/

&nbsp;

- I'm currently a big believer in Ethereum (ETH) and Particl (PART) which satisfy my criteria for admittedly high risk:high reward investment grade cryptocurrencies. Ethereum has already proved to be profitable.

&nbsp;

- The broader impact of distributed ledger technology will be increased independence from fiat currency; I believe weaker fiat currencies will give way to strong cryptocurrencies and this will force weaker governments to react; they will either pursue an isolationist agenda to their own longer term detriment or embrace it to improve local governance and thus economy.

&nbsp;

Given the nature and ability to built governance and voting mechanisms (including many other things) into the distributed ledger technology itself, I believe the longer term impact of distributed ledger technology will be a blurring of national and international borders, treaties and laws. **From a governance and auditing viewpoint, distributed ledger technology if correctly utilized will increase government/corporate transparency and reduce corruption.**

&nbsp;

- There are currently 1300+ cryptocurrencies listed (source coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/). I believe approximately 20-50 have long term viability and the majority share will converge on 5 maximum.

&nbsp;

- Unless Bitcoin (BTC) solves issues with it's geographical mining centralisation (mostly localized to China), governance (no on-ledger voting mechanisms, decisions are governed by a small cartel; an oligarchy) and scaling (the number of transactions per second it handles is very poor and is unlikely to increase), then I do not see it becoming the dominant cryptocurrency in the long run. It will lose out to solutions which implement transaction scalability, on-ledger governance and achieve true geopolitical decentralization.

&nbsp;

- **You should research proof of stake.** It is a means of verifying a distributed ledger where likelihood of receiving payouts is proportional to how many of the ledgers tokens you already hold (these tokens act like virtual processing power). Certain distributed ledger technologies e.g. Particl (PART) already utilize this which means anyone holding their PART tokens on a private wallet receives the equivalent of interest (currently 5% PA) for leaving their computer switched on. Ethereum (ETH) is switching to proof of stake in 2018 which means I'll be able to hopefully earn interest on that too.

&nbsp;

- When the larger public understands proof of stake (and distributed ledger technology is better understood, more mainstream), I think we will see a shift in institutional investors and mainstream savers from traditional savings accounts into the most successful and largest proof of stake currencies as they will provide a safe, reliable, regular return and the earliest adopters will see significant long term appreciation in the token price. Ethereum is currently priming to be the proof of stake solution.

&nbsp;

- You can always follow my comment history on reddit at https://np.reddit.com/user/joskye/comments/. I have a good reputation in this community and I've made some astute observations and good calls. I'm overall up 2100% on principle since I started in July 2016. That's not as great as some of the experienced traders but overall I have a good understanding of this area so if you want anyone to talk to on the subject, I'm happy to offer informal views.

&nbsp;

- If you develop an interest in trading and investing in cryptocurrencies, gateways websites like [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) and [Bittrex] (www.bittrex.com). Coinbase allows you to purchase the top cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) directly with fiat. Bittrex is a large exchange where the majority of altcoins (a term for any cryptocurrency which isn't Bitcoin) can be bought or sold. You will need both currently to truly trade cryptocurrency. **There are *many* alternative platforms internationally offering similar trading services** but I do not have sufficient experience with them to comment and my selection should not be seen as a preferential endorsement in anyway.

&nbsp;

I hope this helps.

5920,"Hi everyone, I've been really interested in cryptos in the last month, mostly because of the social revolutionary potential...but the more I get to know, the more I see that side of the story left behind but maybe it's just me missing out on something, so here's my two questions:

-the energy consumption problem: once all bitcoins will be mined, will it still be required that much of computing power to run transactions? will the switch of ethereum to POS help keeping  consumption decent, what about if these crypto will get mainstream?

-Transparency with anonymity: this one is the my main concern..from what I've felt talking with a lot of people that aren't into crypto this seems to be the main problem, having all this anonymity makes it easy for everyone to dodge taxes (yeah I know that the 1% already does it because of the centralized system and no I don't think that's what we all should do).
So here's my question: would it be possible to create a coin that implements in his core a system of smart contracts that makes the payment of the taxes automatic, business accounts kept public and private ones anonym? 
I believe that if such a coin would come up (or some other way to solve the problem), the masses would be much keener to jump on board and see a true advantage over fiats without the fears..

5928,"Kinda noob here trying to understand this btc/bch fiasco. Iâm gonna outline my thoughts and what Iâve heard and would like corrections or other opinions, hopefully. 

So it is to my understanding that bitcoin is pretty outdated and worse compared to almost all other altcoins except, majorly, in regards to security. Now this whole idea of it being a store of value seems like nonsense to me (I feel this is obvious) and it has failed becoming a currency at this point. It already is getting a worse and worse rep due to transaction fees and times for confirmation being way too long for what is practical for a currency. Mix in essentially loss of decentralization with how the miners are and it just seems like a joke and only the ignorant cling to it. When we start to see even more traffic after futures here in a few weeks and the word getting out, the blockchain is just gonna get clogged even more with transactions which can only increase fees even further. Just how in the hell is core going to keep up with remedying this situation? Now I havenât done a whole lot of research on second layer solutions, but just how big of an impact can those make? Surely it canât make up for the absolutely drastic failed points of bitcoin at this time, or so I think. Atomic swaps are nice but it just seems like itâs prolonging bitcoinâs death a tad longer, who the hell is gonna switch to litecoin or what have you and use bitcoin as a store of value? Why would you not just use litecoin only at that point? I think with increased exposure of the market weâre gonna see litecoin and eth make gains, as bitcoin starts to really die, as the next best options for people. Do we really see roughly 2 year estimation for bitcoinâs lifespan? Or at least thatâs the estimation Iâm hearing the most. Iâm thinking less though. Then again Iâm new so time estimations are inexperienced.

Now in regards to bitcoin cash, like hearing about dragonslayer and all this stuff about bch being the real bitcoin, it really does line up a lot of things and makes a lot of sense to me to see bch take over once btcâs price tanks from bubble and/or manipulation of the markets. And this is in regards to increased block size and in the interest of the wealthy etc. But my real question is whatâs the point of switching to bch as the new bitcoin if itâs only a linear solution to an exponential issue? Why would big money want bch to succeed? Just to make a quick buck and fuck the crypto markets? I would say they are too greedy for it to end there. We really are seeing the worst in people in unregulated markets, what a shitshow. 

I donât know man I feel like this bad pr that is bound to happen with bitconnect + maybe tether + some more flippenings drama... just doesnât sound good to me for the marketâs prices, at least.

That being said,

If you were to hit big on an ICO and a relatively small initial investment ended up translating to millions of USD, would you cash out and deposit it into your USD bank account, or continue on, hoping the crypto will continue to rise. Or, hold the crypto and spend it as you would spend the USD.

I'm asking this, because, even though 2010 - 2017 BTC returns are most likely out of reach for the most part, I still believe there are plenty of opportunities to make a cool couple million with a small 5-10k initial investment.

That is my ultimate goal, and ambition. And if/when that time comes, I need to know what I would do. Would I cash out, or hold?

There are many cryptos that rode a high wave only to crash onto rocky shores, and others, such as BTC continue to rise.

In the event of getting a large return, would you hold the crypto, or sell for USD?

Reinvesting a portion is of course an option with the cash out.

Don't have enough Karma to post as a thread so thought I'd ask here.

6045,"Here are 6 little tips from Forbes to market an ICO successfully.

1. Figure Out Your Market
One of the first questions you should ask yourself if youâre toying with the idea of an ICO is how you will integrate digital tokens into your business model. 

2. Learn The Rules
If you want to position your company for a successful ICO, you have to educate yourself on the SECâs criteria for what constitutes a security in the digital coin landscape.

3. Know Your Audience
As you approach your ICO, you will most likely be speaking to two distinctive audiences: those with a breadth of digital currency knowledge, and those who really donât understand the difference between Bitcoin and blockchain. This second group likely understands the growing status of cryptocurrency, but they may not understand the technicalities. It is your responsibility to create marketing and PR materials that speak to both sides of the spectrum. 

4. Tell Your Story
You want to give investors a reason to give your company money and you can do this by providing them with the story behind your mission statement. 69% of Millennials want businesses to better facilitate customers getting involved in social issues, and many investors do, as well.

5. Update Your Website
In addition to social media, make sure your website is up to date and current with all of your companyâs latest news. As CEO, youâre going to get pulled in many directions during your ICO so itâs important to have a central source of updates for potential investors who want to research your company. Communication, even digital communication, is considered todayâs most important skill.

6. Offer Your Data
Data is important; there are 2.7 zettabytes of data out there today. Trends and statistics are crucial components of demonstrating the value of an investment in your company. Investors want evidence â and by offering your data to analysts throughout your offering, youâre giving them concrete proof that your business will excel. Moreover, youâll gain additional exposure simply by the fact that your company will be reported on regularly as long as youâre offering your data to reporters and analysts.

Executing a successful ICO is no easy task. A lot of preparation and coordination goes into making sure a newly public company can secure as many investments as possible.",0.9943,daily_general_discussion_november_22_2017,0.007,0.845,0.148

It was posted in the Tether thread, but was towards the bottom, not sure if many people saw it...

Someone just posted on 4chan:

This is a message from an insider. I am a member of Chinese whale community. I cannot provide any proofs nor open my identity but I cannot allow myself to stand and watch for the greatest theft from poor and reputation destruction of blockchain based cryptocurrency to happen.

I have been informed of major Bitcoin manipulation taking place in order to compromise Bitcoin security and reliability. A group of coordinated Chinese investors have a plan to pump Bitcoin to 10000 USD after which they plan on coordinated crash of Bitcoin to sub 1000 levels because they have already taken their fiat money out and replaced them with margin tether traiding. It will not cost them a dollar. They will push Bitcoin below the demand levels.

The situation with Bitfinex and Tethers is legitimate but it is a distraction. Inflated amount of Tethers are not a source of money used for Pump. Bitcoin Cash is the source.
For some reason community accepted 20 Billion dollar appearance out of thin air which is the market capitalization of Bitcoin Cash as the natural process. It is not natural. These artificial money are currently used to cash out Chinese investors and pump original Bitcoin to 10000 USD without taking any losses.

Shortly after Bitcoin crash below 1000 USD they plan to introduce Bitcoin Cash as a true Bitcoin and necessary replacament which is not inflated and then reject Tether pairings. This is why Bitcoin Cash price is stabilized at 1000 USD as was price of original Bitcoin in January 2017.

This is the operation Dragonslayer in it's final stage. They have created billion of dollars with Bitcoin hardforks and use Tether as a tool to artificially bump Bitcoin price cash out their money and coordinate total collapse.

does anyone know why this continues to happen or how to stop it?

**EDIT** => to answer most of the responses at once, which are asking/suggesting the same thing: no, i do not have a static IP as my ISP will only allow a static IP for a business. but, that said, i know my IP does not change very often as i have it whitelisted for some different servers/web services (i'm a programmer), and i only have to reset my IP for these services once every six months or so. i will say, the one time i looked into it for a few minutes, it seemed like it was using IPv6 and not IPv4, which might have something to do with it, but networking isn't really my field of expertise so i would have to look into it further to remember the differences in the two. i'll try adding my IP to the whitelist and see if that works.",0.3612,daily_general_discussion_november_21_2017,0.015,0.962,0.022

6188,"As someone who lives in the US, and plans to invest/hold cryptocurrency, can someone please explain why I should consider investing in BCH? BCH has been gaining momentum claiming it is the 'real vision' of bitcoin, that it increases blocksize allowing for improved scalability and cheaper/faster transactions... however, there are no day-to-day activities I could use BCH for (or any cryptocurrency for that matter) anyways. The average transactions per block for BCH are less than 200 which gives an indication that few people are truly using it so there's no point of tooting about scalability when it doesn't have the adoption.

The other big argument is that a currency needs to be usable otherwise it's just a ""Ponzi scheme""... but let's be real, as someone living in the first world and is financially responsible, it is much more convenient to use a credit card for everyday instant transactions. There might be some fees on the user end, but they're mostly reflected in the price or covered by the merchant. The user also gets a whole bunch of perks like rewards, cash back, fraud protection, and chargebacks if necessary (sucks on the merchant end, but I'm not a merchant). I also have no need to send money to a poor family in 3rd world countries.

I bought into BTC and a few altcoins, and of course this is an investment for the future - as it stand now it's pointless for me to use BTC for day-to-day transactions. I think scalability and transaction cost could be resolved in the future with full segwit adoption and lightning network, and that cryptocurrency will truly change the way money works. BCH faces an even more difficult task than scalability... Trying to get adoption for the use of its coin. I can't predict the future but it seems most bets are on BTC, which is really mostly due to branding. As it stands now, neither BTC/BCH are fit for daily use, and it's a gamble for the future (which I'm prepared to lose).",0.4109,daily_general_discussion_november_21_2017,0.071,0.845,0.084

Their executive director, John Corky Severson, is also a director/partner of Schneider Finance, an American affiliate of Schneider Securities, the company providing the guarantee. In May, Severson signed a $20 million financing agreement with public company Nemus Bioscience, which included a guarantee backed by Schneider Securities. Nemus exercised the guarantee after default, which was not honored, and has initiated legal action. There is too much information to post, but there is a lengthy discussion about Schneider at InvestorsHub, including information provided by a former legal director who submitted a report to the ACPR of France detailing illegal activities. The ACPR released a warning in September about Schneider not being licensed to offer guarantees. I suspect a criminal investigation will follow, as they have also misrepresented their credentials and assets.

However, I don't have a lot of upfront capital to do so - a couple of hundred, right now, at most. Because of this, I figured it might be best for me to follow this path: 1) Invest in up-and-coming crypto that research has led me to believe will do well (or anything hyped up that I can gain short-term profits from), and then 2) Take the profits from my original short-term investments and put them, chunk by chunk, into the more expensive crypto to slowly focus on my long-term gains (such as BTC, ETH, etc.). Is this possible or feasible? I'd still love to invest in this long-term but because I'm a graduate student with only a small amount of spare ""spending money"" (nowhere near the thousands that some might be able to invest), would this be an alright beginning strategy if I play it smart?

One thing i consider important that everyone is missing is that even though the current banking is fraudulent but in cases of economic collapse or when everyone is heavily indebted because of the unethical or unfair system and the riches get accumulated with only a very minute proportion of the population , as we live in a so called democratic country the people can choose to cancel the debts and start afresh(P.S DEBT -The first 5000 years - by David Graeber ) . Although this power is being used to bailout big banks and keeping people indebted which is injustice. Although this power is being used to spare the people who are creating the problems , one must remember that we have the power to clear debts and it only takes a right president to use it the right way. But if there is no authority ( in case of decentralized currency) to reshuffle the resources then if ever these cryptocurrencies get owned by a very small proportion of the population then this might never be reversed without the consent of these overpowered , very very rich people ( and i dont think anyone will ever voluntarily agree for redistribution of these coins ) and inevitably lead to inescapable form of bondage. The only solution out will be totally discarding this system as cryptos are also fiat and starting afresh with a new one but this will be very difficult as it takes a consensus among people for dropping the old and starting accepting the new form of currency.

My question is, how difficult is it to decipher between legitimate, potentially successful ICOs, and duds, or scams?

I just recently made a purchase for $350 worth of an ICO, because I find their mission statement and goal to be fascinating and worthwhile. I researched the team behind the token, and found most of them to be credible and well-versed.

Still, it is difficult for me to say for sure if I am making the right decisions. It's also a bit more nerve wracking than buying into an IPO because I am still familiarizing myself with how to convert, send, and receive cryptos, so I have to triple check to make sure my transactions are hopefully going through correctly.

I am trying to learn quickly and well.

I am a broke college student, so whatever money I save goes into crypto, which is a bit difficult to swallow if they fall through, but I suppose I'm open to it.

The cause would be news. Eg. a government announces a digital currency like Apple Pay. Even if not decentralized they could incentive people to use it and make it easy to use. It pushes crypto out of the market.  
Or maybe more countries will announce bans on crypto. Or a war on crypto.   

What would happen if it did crash?  
People try to liquidate their crypto into currency overnight? Miners pulling support? Slow transactions? You try transferring btc from your wallet to an exchange and it takes days. Exchanges claiming bankruptcy or getting hacked or disappearing overnight. Even if the exchange stays up prices probably continue dropping to 70, 50, 20% of what they originally were before settling at like 10% due to memory. And you have a withdrawl limit of say a thousand usd per day for every exchange you've already signed up with that supports USD withdrawls until they run out of money on the first day.

I've learnt so much from the subreddits over the last few months and thought it is time to give back. I've developed my own excel spreadsheet that tracks my crypto portfolio (update the prices through a macro from coinmarketcap.com) and produces a nice pie chart. It also has another worksheet that tracks the prices / market cap of the top 50 coins from coinmarketcap.com to highlight the big movers and losers over a 24 hour period.

I hope some of you will find it useful (link below). Also, let me know if you have any questions on how to use it or if it doesn't work for you. Thanks again!

You can use it to make in depth analysis about the relationship between price and social media volume, or just quickly look at the strongest trending coins. You can have a quick look at what is actually being said, in order to understand what makes the trend of mentioning of names.
If you have any comments on the social media chatter <> coin price relationship, I'd also like to hear.

It can be found here: https://www.bafin.de/dok/10185906

6816,"*Throwaway account for obvious reasons*

I work for in tech for a Fortune 100 company with revenues far exceeding $38.654 billion (using a random number as to not give away my company... I don't want to get in trouble here.). I recently became aware of a major blockchain solution that our company is creating for our consumer facing products. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and gives consumers the ability to pay using cryptocurrencies as well.

My company is not a part of the EEA, has no public releases about using blockchain tech, and is not a ""tech first"" company like Apple, HP Amazon, or Google.

My question is this: how will an initiative like this help Ethereum (and Ether prices) in general? If successful and deployed at scale, this application could be sending millions of transactions a day over the Ethereum network. Does this just help the price of Ether by making a demand for Ether since the application will need Ether as gas? Obviously, if people pay in Ether, that would help too.

I'm interested in the community's input on this. I'm sorry I can't share more details. I did want to clue you guys in though that the ""big boys"" might be working on Ethereum more than is publicly known.

I made it deliberately impossible to guess what company I work for and please refrain from guessing. I'll try to answer any questions I can without getting in trouble.

I originally posted this as a thread but the karma filter won't let me as this is a fresh alt account I have made to preserve my privacy

I have done well over the past few years and I am finally ready to take home some of my profits (convert back to filthy fiat)

It would be a fairly large amount, around $1 mil give or take

I wanted to know if anybody else had went through the same thing, that is moving large amounts of money in relation to exchanges, banks, etc...

Would you recommend shooting an email to my exchanges and banks warning them beforehand?

Was your account frozen and did you have to provide documentation?

My problem is after years of playing around, trading, exchanges disappearing, etc... I really don't have a complete picture of all my buys and sells and transaction history.

6824,"I've googled. I've been casually researching for a long time. I thought about getting into bitcoin mining some years ago, but right as I was going to click Buy on a small ASIC miner, the difficulty increased just enough to make it not financially feasible. (Turns out, I should have done it anyway, because the value has skyrocketed since then. Hindsight!)

But I'm lost. There's tons of advice, and tons of opinions, and all of this stuff moves so fast that it's hard to keep up. Most of the ""getting started"" stuff I found while Googling is months old or more, and almost all of it predates the blockchain fork. I donât have the karma to post this separately, so here I am. Reading this topic just today has been very helpful, but Iâm still left with questions. Help me, Reddit! ð

I've just learned that there are sites that will sell you cryptocurrencies in exchange for gift cards. My work has an internal rewarding system wherein you accumulate points and can then use those points to order things, including gift cards. I've been struggling to decide what to order (because most of the catalog is junk), and the idea that I could buy my first BTC (or other crypto) has some appeal. My current point total amounts to about $200 USD. Iâll dive in with that and splash around. If I get to a point where Iâm comfortable swimming in the proverbial coin pool, I have another $1000 or so to invest.

Where I stand now:

I understand mining and transaction verification. I know about the recent split between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and a have a decent understanding of the implications of the block size limit and why it was divisive. (Personally, I think I come down on the Bitcoin Cash side of the decision.)

I know that some currencies don't use mining in the Bitcoin sense, and that in particular some currencies have moved to a block verification process that doesn't boil down to a battle for energy and CPU cycles, but I don't know who's using what, what shows promise, etc.

I think I remember hearing that Ethereum has a ""contract"" aspect to it, where a ""promise"" to pay ETH can be fulfilled when some criteria are met. Don't know much about how it works, how it's been used, whether it seems to be going anywhere, etc.

Iâm a big podcast listener, but it hadnât even occurred to me to try podcasts as a learning resource here, because sometimes Iâm an idiot. ð¤¦ð»ââï¸ Anyway, thanks to Ignis000 for asking, and to everyone who answered. Iâll be adding a few of those to Overcast and giving a listen.

What I'm looking to learn:

Are some exchanges more trusted/trustworthy than others? Who's got a good track record? Is there a list of whoâs been hacked, compromised, or caught being shady? I learned about Coinmarketcap reading this thread today. Are there other comparable sites you trust? Does the rate at one exchange tend to be pretty consistent with the rate at other exchanges? Or does it make sense to keep an eye on multiple exchanges?

How do I establish a wallet? Should I hold my own wallet or is it reasonable now to trust a third party to host one for me? Or should I do both and manage multiple balances in multiple places? If I host one myself, is there good (Mac, iOS) software I should use?

Is there an iOS app that will send me a push notification when thereâs significant movement in the market?

Prior to today, I was aware of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, LiteCoin, Ethereum, and DogeCoin. Coinmarketcap shows many, many more, and it seems like having them ordered by market cap is a great way to learn which ones are the most relevant. Are there other good ways to monitor whatâs new and interesting?

I'm also (obviously) looking to learn where the future is going, so if any of you have a crystal ball and can tell me what I should buy with my $200 for best future results, I'd greatly appreciate it. ð

This will hopefully be a revolution of currencies. We all have our favorite coins or tokens so there will obviously be shills so over the place. It's important to do your own research so be careful of mass pumps when investing money into amything. I found out a great way to avoid losses is to have a stop less. Example of the bch pump a few days ago. If for example you buy at .01 and your unsure of how high it'll go. To lock in profits set a stop loss at .013 or some other arbitrary number so if it goes up then drops a bunch you still gain profits. All coins go up then down even if they have a promising future.

Still relatively new to crypto, but I'm looking to invest 10% - 20% of my btc holdings into other altcoins.  I was wondering the best way to go about this.  I have my btc in coinbase atm.  I know it's not the best place to hold, but I had it in there for the split and now the transferring of btc is very slow.  I plan to transfer the 80% - 90% left over to a wallet when it's a bit quicker.

Would my best bet be to sell the 10% - 20% of btc and buy Eth to be able to make a quick transfer to Bittrex and redistribute once there?  Transfer btc over to Bittrex and just wait, or pay a higher tx fee?  Or just use a different exchange that accepts USD for altcoins?

Any other options, opinions or comments are welcome.  Thanks in advance.

It seem's like its basically about transferrence of electrical power over a distributed network. I see one of the keys being it's incorporation into electric vehicle charging methodologies. 

However, IOTA already has multiple large partnerships in the auto industry and has developed things to work for just this purpose as well. So, what does POWR do, that IOTA can't do. I could see them working in tandem since POWR could target non IOT networks of course. But in this particular instance I feel like IOTA will have a strong corner on the automotive market far before POWR even starts marketing and making partnerships.

""I am a native Spanish speaker so please excuse any grammatical errors. I find that at the very root the issue is always economical. Education is extremely important vis-Ã -vis conservation and environmental reprocusion. To quote my own father ""if i have zero knowledge about animals but a billion dollars, and you can name every feather on every bird, who do you think could do more for animals and the environment?""

I propose buying land on the outskirts of already established conservation areas through an ico/crowdfund. Then ""locking"" the properties to smart contracts for predetermined periods (to exceed 100 years). The owner or potentially millions of owners of the property would recieve a small interest depending on their stake. Much like proof of stake systems. With the contract being sellable but the contract of conservation not changeable.

I could for instance own 1000 ""landcoin"". The value of the landcoin would remain stable but scaled to match currency inflation. The benefit to holders would be the interest they would recieve and the stable store of wealth. The interest and scaling can potentially be a combination of a small tax collected on property ""transfers"" Tax deductible donations,among several other sources.

I have several other ideas, and no real desire for monetary gain. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Good luck with your excellent project. Salud!""

I'd appreciate it if someone could use analogy, as that helps me break them into nice little cookie cutter groups (as an example, BTC shares a similar demographic with BCH and LTC, but the latter seem to offer , while ETH competes with NEO), and more technical definitions would likely go right over my head (at least intially).

AirFox is backed by TechStars, Project 11, NXT Ventures, LaunchCapital, RightSide Capital and other big investors in Boston.
The biggest issue's with the project seems to be from lack of exchanges, which they have adressed and are actively working on, the timing of their ico and release, and the legal ramifications they will have to bypass.

â¢ MY 5 YEAR ANNIVERSARY PRESENT â¢


My girlfriend and I have been together now for 5 years.
Being that the 5th year is a big milestone I was struggling to find her a present.

So I asked her what she would like and she responded that she would like a Gucci bag worth around $3,000.

Now Iâm not a materialistic person an was taken back by paying $3,000 for a bag. So I came to a conclusion that I wouldnât buy the bag however I did make an investment on her behalf that might get her that Gucci bag and then some.

She doesnât know this yet but Iâve purchased $700 worth of Vertcoin (VTC) and Iâm going to give her the private key over dinner tonight. 

The idea is that yes I could go out and buy the bag and do the normal thing, but I feel like this experiment is much more exciting.

Wish me luck guys.

Do I wait until some of my coins have just say 20% profit take that 20% and put it into some other coin? Or do i hold long periods of time? I dont mind taking risks.

https://imgur.com/a/qkXlJ

Edit:  Been seriously trading since late June this year but have technically owned a few dollars in BTC since November 2014.  Biggest gains so far have been OMG and VTC.  Had 100 OMG but had a stop loss at $7.00USD, rebought 10 at $6.45 and put the rest into BTC/LTC.  Bought VTC at about $0.40USD and have held it since - debating on whether or not to sell if it gets back into the $5.60 range or hold longer.

Regret purchases: Siacoin and Ripple.  Iffy about Factom, TenX, and Digibyte.  Know nothing about Gnosis but had a dollar or two to spend and it was more of a shot in the dark purchase.

Most recent purchase: Lisk. Would like IOTA but it has jumped way too much the past few days to get in now.  Plus the total available coins is very high in my opinion.

7241,"We have seen this all before. Right after its fork BCH pumped very strongly through Bithumb steadily rose to around $1000USD then slowly drifted downwards to $350 USD or thereabouts. All indicators showed that pump was not organic, it was orchestrated. Now that B2X was abandoned and BCH lost its opportunity to get a leg up for another run, it's trying again. So here we go again, like before Bithumb is accounting for roughly half of the volume for this current pump. But is it organic growth or is it again orchestrated? I can say without a shadow of a doubt its not organic growth. I have been watching this pump very carefully and noticed most of the volume is occurring in the middle of their night or very early morning.  Times the Koreans should be fast asleep. As I type its 4AM in Seoul and BCH is pumping extremely hard, I watched it rise almost $100 within mins. This is not organic, it's not normal, its manipulation. Is this the work of the Chinese mining cartel owned by Bitmain and Roger Vers Bitcoin.com pool? It seems logical assume so. Are they are mining/converting/buying BCH through Bithumb to pump their Wu-coin to attract miner attention and user investment, meanwhile they starve BTC of hashing power to try to weaken it?
No surprises here but this is what they were going to do at the back end of the B2X fork. But they lost the opportunity so now its plan B. They are counting on BTC holders to get nervous and jump ship by slowing down BTC transactions and making BCH to appear as the chain to be on. By adjusting their difficulty they hope to attract more non-Chinese cartel miners to the fold to consolidate their efforts. This all goes to show what a shit coin BCH really is. It also shows how corrupt Ver/BU and Bitmain are. IF BCH was so great then just let it win market share on its own merits without manipulation. Wont happen because they don't have Bitcoins 8 years of user confidence, they don't have 8 years of core developer experience they don't have a track record. So guys/gals use caution this pump will deflate rapidly if after the BCH difficulty adjustment BCH doesn't attract organic growth. Invest wisely.

The obvious answer here seems to be to buy Bitcoin, especially as a first time buyer, but also mainly because it is at a big low compared to even two days ago.

1) I noticed that since the fork was called off, BCH has gone up like crazy.  Is the reason for this because the changes to the fork would have made BTC more similar to BCH?  So BCH was going to have to compete with BTC if the fork happened, but now that it hasn't, people are speculating that BCH is a better version of bitcoin in the long term?  Follow up on this - if BTC does 'upgrade' in the future, is it likely that a coin like BCH will tank?  
My other question is this - on a day like today where almost everything is going down in price, where is all that money going?  I don't see any coins pumping like crazy, but I see a lot going down... what's going on?

1. They seem to be at the far end of the Bitcoin spectrum, from BTC - BCH - B2X - then BTX. They have 20mb blocks with Segwit activated (and a thing called Bloom(?) that I haven't looked into). Is there good value in being on that part of the spectrum?

2. They have some regular airdrops described here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1883902.msg23542387#msg23542387 but **if** that's indefinite it seems totally unsustainable. Does anyone know how those drops really work?",0.4871,daily_general_discussion_november_10_2017,0.016,0.933,0.051

If more than correlation has occurred in the timing of USDT issuance and the spikes in BTC as is implied then this could be the grounds for a major black swan event affecting *all* cryptocurrency in the near future.

I'm looking to buy more of the alts I already own, buy some new ones (zrx, lsk, vtc, grs, ada), and also want to add btc to my portfolio. so this is where my question comes in - is it dumb to buy btc at this price to add to my portfolio right now/use as a way to buy more alts?  I'm hesitant.  I feel the same way about some etf's I hold right now that're up ~15%. they seem like absolute winners and it seems reasonable they shoot up, just like it seems reasonable that btc can hit 10k and I could still be getting in at a good price, but at the same time it just seems steep to me.

idk if any of what I'm asking makes sense, or if its garbage, but some suggestions and guidance would definitely be appreciated.

Most modum fans start about the European regulation 2013/C343/01 on the quality of transport and storage of medicine. It's a regulation with minimum standards to accomplish in local law for the European qountries. So every European country has it's own interpretation and laws on how to deal with the transport of medicines. Besides the regulation was implemented in 2014 by most countries. Which means that most companies already have taken measures to comply. For example, most companies in the Netherlands already had bought temperature measuring systems in 2014 and complied with laws during inspection http://www.pharmoutsourcing.com/Featured-Articles/174549-Lessons-Learned-from-the-First-GDP-Inspections-in-the-Netherlands-Based-on-the-New-EU-GDP-Guidelines/

Modum is focusing in the medicines that don't need cold of cool transport  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/modum-io-s-tempurature-tracking-blockchain-solution-wins-accolades-at-kickstarter-accelerator-1479162773 . Here in Europe in most countries it's not that difficult to transport medicines within temperatures of 15 to 25 degrees Celcius during most months of the year. But also the much mentioned European regulation says: Risk assessment of delivery routes should be used to determine where temperature controls are required. Equipment used for 
temperature monitoring during transport within vehicles and/or 
containers should be maintained and calibrated at regular 
intervals at least once a year.
Dedicated vehicles and equipment should be used, where 
possible, when handling medicinal products. Where non-
dedicated vehicles and equipment are used, procedures should 
be in place to ensure that the quality of the medicinal product 
will not be compromised.

So the Modum system is not required when not neccessary and if neccessary  you should also use dedicated temperature controled vehicles. And when those are not used, there is a case for modum. 

But if you even Google the regulation 2013/C343/01 you will see that there are already lot of systems available, even with rfid on the market.  Look at a company like https://www.gullimex.com/ And please read or  translate this German article, big companies like Motorola are already working in this market, whith sensors, live temperature updates and tracking of medicines.  http://digitusmagazin.de/2017/05/sensible-logistik-ein-digitalisierungsprojekt-im-pharmazeutischen-grosshandel/

I'm looking at some coins to sit and come back to in 5 years. Since I will be putting about $500-1k into alts I'm interested in coins that are less than a dollar but could grow into something used widely in the future by banks. I see global payments as something that will definitely grow as crypto becomes more mainstream.

I know it goes against the grain of the whole point of crypto but the banks will need to get into something and it will not be bitcoin as its already too expensive. The current ones I'm looking into are:


-  Ripple (XRP)  - Some large banks already on board in few countries.


-  Stellar Lumens (XLM) - IBM announced that it would work with a network of banks to support fast money transactions throughout the South Pacific region.

Is anyone else here looking into anything else that you see major banks adopting? Are there other coins that you think will grow with the banking industry that I haven't listed here?

Some people in here are just trying to make a quick bump buying & selling dips or investing in Alt-tokens that have tremendous growth potential, while others believe in Bitcoin and its longterm potential, while others believe in select Alt-tokens that are trying to use blockchain technology in transcendent ways. 

I strongly encourage you to find MULTIPLE resources that explain what blockchain is and how it can be used (Ted has a lot of presentations on blockchain, some at the EL15 level, some that are more complex and detailed). 

Putting your money into an Alt-token just because you see people promising its going to be ""huge"" is as risky as playing a slot machine. 

Do your research, find something that you believe can work and that has a team to execute the plan, invest and hold.

I'm not here to pump one coin or another, but rather hope that we can bring some level of rationality to an incredibly irrational market, so that all cryptos (BTC AND ALT TOKENS) can succeed in the long term.

I've come across quite a few people saying that 'big money' is starting to enter bitcoin and that the price will go above and beyond 50k. 

As I understand bitcoin isn't very good at a lot of things, (slow, high fee, not very private, not the most secure, issues about decentralization, forks), the reason for its value is its name, being the cornerstone, store of value, gateway to al other crypto... I'm not going to complain that bitcoin shouldn't have the value/mcap it has right now, but why would 'big money' put so much money in it and why would the world want to have bitcoin as a currency be worth 50k+ a piece?

Bitcoin can keep playing its current function as gateway etc. at its current price? And the possibility that bitcoin changes and fixes its problems seems slim, it would need to play catch up with currencies that are way ahead. 

So regular people and the 'new big money' would keep investing for the reason that 'the price keeps going up'? I don't see how that works out. I know that at this point doing just that is a big part op crypto, throwing money at it and get gains because more people start throwing money at it. However bitcoin at 50k, 100k, and today I came across someone talking on reddit about a big miner that thinks bitcoin at 1mil could happen, isn't that setting up for the biggest bubble/crash ever?

7972,"Discussion re: the upcoming B2X fork, looking at prior forks, in reverse chronological order:

i) BTG fork - this was just negligible, not even worth looking at

ii) SegWit fork - if I understand correctly, this fork actually changed and enhanced the code running on the main BTC miners and users software, meaning more transactions could go into blocks, bringing the mempool down, making the network a bit faster? I think that's at least mostly accurate anyway, I'm not an expert

My point is to contrast that with this upcoming fork. This coming fork is simply a hijack attempt and the main BTC (the Core client, the Core dev community and the community in general) isn't adding anything of value, it's simply fending off an attack attempt, is my perception anyway.

So with this in mind, I expect a significant ""correction"" to BTC price coming either at the exact time of the fork or perhaps even a small amount of time before that.

Options to profit against a big correction in BTC? Well, there's fiat of course... I don't like this option on principle. Coins that will perform very well against a BTC correction? I think Ethereum tbh. I might go 30/30/30 ETH/VTC/XMR about a week before the fork?

Of course others out there will be like ""Oh no you should wait to get the B2X and then dump it because you'll make a big profit!"" ... Maybe... What does everyone else think?",-0.6536,daily_general_discussion_november_1_2017,0.07,0.883,0.048

I was just discussing with a friend, there was an idea of a government own Exchange market which would allow cash from domestic and foreign origin to be placed into the country's exchange market, thereby benefiting the government that owns the exchange.

Do not buy a crypto currency if its 24 hour trading volume is below 0.7% of its market cap.

Unless you guys think a 10x price increase over the course of 4 days is totally normal this shit is going to get dumped hard and fast. The people manipulating this aren't stupid, they picked the perfect coin to pump piggybacking off the recent VTC success. People that jumped in even halfway through this pump are going to get shit on...

Edit - Also, I know someone is gonna come in and mention something about VTC blowing up. VTC had 3 major things that got people's attention. First was Bitcoin Gold being an obvious scam and being similar to VTC. That put the spotlight on VTC which was already a solid coin just without much marketing. The second was after this attention was brought to the coin and it started to slowly rise, Ledger support was added, this was when the coin really started to get some legs and take off. Then the one click miner was released, and it pumped again because that's a big deal. Prior to these 3 things people didn't particularly care about the coin.

GRS...what news has it had? What has it done recently? What is in the pipeline? These things are all up in the air. Between an obvious pump and dump effort, and people who missed the VTC train, it blew up...but watch what happens. The dump is going to happen, and the price will plummet, and it will be clear it's a dump. How faithful are the GRS holders then? I suspect the panic sells are going to be off the chart. They will start mass selling their coin too so they can reap some profits, which will lead to more panic, more selling, and then people simply cutting their losses.

That's the other thing about VTC...the community at large are hodlers, they have faith in the coin and have had faith for a *long* time. There is no panic kneejerk reaction, it has been tested time and time again and come out the stronger.

However on release of their decentralised marketplace module in Q1 2018, provided its released with full atomic swaps and shapeshift/exchange integration, it's buy side dynamics will change significantly.

It maybe first worth reading up on the project in more detail:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/76ot7k/thoughts_about_particle/

At this stage I estimate a 5x to 20x (conservative is 5x) rise in price purely on a hype cycle alone. Longer term however I view it very differently to other assets due to it's liquidity characteristics which resemble DASH but with actual utility to self perpetuate it. 

This is because:

- People decide to use the Particl marketplace.
- People sent their crypto to the Particl client.
- This converts to PART: Buy pressure on PART.
- People buy PART in the Particl client to transact.
- People use PART escrow: PARTs get locked into escrow contract.
- Circulating supply of PART gets further restricted.
- Successful buying/selling of goods = repeat custom exclusively in PART token.
- Repeat custom = regular repeat buy pressure on PART per individual.
- Repeat custom = word of mouth = more new customers on Particl marketplace. This perpetuates first step.
- Buy pressure increases. More escrows. Further liquidity lockup.

...

- More dApps (beyond market place) release as PART hype & awareness increases = more buy pressure on PART.

- Staking locks away PART also restricting circulating supply.

- As value of PART increases incentive to stake increases (as stakers earn tx fees). As PART value increases and tx frequency increases, stakers earn more rewards perpetuating further staking.

- More PART gets locked in staking. Lower circulating supply.

- Rapidly escalating PART price.

So provided it is released as described and people use it as a marketplace non-speculatively, with time it's price should rise exponentially independent of traditional exchange dependent model.

...

I hope this makes it super clear why I rank Particl on par with Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of price growth potential.

...

I bought BTC in 2013 and then bought ETH early, this is were majority of sum came from.

Thing is â the alts i gambled on, I would have gained more if I just held BTC.

I'm personally more inclined to sell everything that isn't BTC, ETH, BCH.

I do admit that I'm not the smartest person and have been holding BTC since 2013 as I'm too dumb to trade and occasionally purchase some alts, I got lucky on Ethereum as well.

I'm planning to hold this until I can pay for my house and car in crypto (planning to actually use it as a currency).

Since my financial well being is very important to me, I'd like to reach a public consensus of what would be the best steps to take for me to secure my wealth and grow it in future.

Do you believe I should sell all? If yes, why?

Do you believe I should sell coin X and buy coin Y? Ok, why?

8145,"I am seeing a lot of posts about ""ASIC resistant"" coins getting pumped lately and this doesn't sit right with me. ASIC resistance shouldn't be the only redeemable quality of a coin or the only reason it is getting pumped. 

Why? ASIC resistance as of right now only means that a coin can't be succesfully mined with the ASICs used for computationally bounded hashing algorithms like bitcoins SHA-256. ""ASIC resistant"" use memory bounded hashing algorithms. These algorithms are constrained by the memory bandwith of the hardware instead of its computational speed. 

What is stopping bitmain from developing ASICs for these memory bound algorithms? I would argue that it isn't the memory hardness per se. GPU's are not specialized in memory retrieval problems, so there's definitely room for improvement through specialization. ASIC resistance will always be a temporary thing. Look at Litecoin. And if a coin wants to keep the democratic decentralization advantage of GPU-mining forever it should opt for PoS.",0.5773,daily_general_discussion_october_30_2017,0.049,0.884,0.066

I'm looking to buy some coins to hodl, as in me hodl long time.  I'm not interested in trading really at all.  I understand that most currencies have wallets with the two keys, if I am able to keep the private key private, can I continue to put coin into that wallet without ever really needing to worry about checking it?  I don't mean that I would never check the balance or anything, I just mean if I have, say, one wallet for btc, one for eth, can I just keep those wallets for years or should I create new wallets occasionally?  And regarding security,  I have seen many posts describing the different levels of security -- but if I just use an offline wallet generator and print the private key with a corded printer will I be 99.9% safe (I have a mac, and I'm not the kind of person to click random links in emails)?  Finally,  there are a bajillion coins/currencies, I've narrowed it down to about 10 I would like to hold (presently).  What is the best way to buy the different coins?  I am currently on Coinbase and Binance, pending Bitstamp, but even if I have access to each of those it seems I still use another 5 or so exchanges to buy the other coins I want.  Is there an easier way to do this?  Is an app like Exodus useful/safe for exchanging?  Thanks in advance for any advice, like I said, if I'm in the wrong place let me know.\n",

That's why there's always speculation that we're in a bubble, because at the moment there is not a single coin that is being used for its intended purpose that matches the current price of it besides ETH/BTC I suppose.

      "Under usual circumstances, coins often pump in anticipation of the listing on a big exchange and then immediately correct once they hit the exchange. XRB, however, is a very special case for several reasons. First of all, XRB won the coin of the month contest, so the pump that often comes with a listing was priced in as soon as it was foreseeable that XRB would come out as the winner of this contest. Around this time we saw the ATH. Since then, it has corrected significantly, meaning that the usual pump and dump around an exchange listing has already happened in this case.\n",

      "Second, XRB was only available on shitty exchanges for a long time, and whole Mercatox and Bitgrail drama has hurt the XRB price badly. Kucoin is a different story - for whatever reason basically every coin exclusively listed on Kucoin was dumped really hard through January - and I still don't really understand why that is the case. I find it really hard to tell how this has also influenced the price of XRB. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, it's hard to tell how many people are holding their XRB in a wallet and only suffered through the recent dumps because they didn't want to return their XRB to Mercatox and/or Bitgrail. It's possible that many people want to get rid of their heavy XRB bags once they can sell it on Binance. On the other hand, there will be others who just wait for XRB to hit Binance to finally buy some - many people have avoided Bitgrail and Mercatox (and as we see, for good reason). In the end, it depends on whether there are more people that want to buy than people that want to sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "My personal feeling is that everybody that urgently wanted to sell did so on KuCoin over the past few days. Those people that sold on Bitgrail today had no other option - they sold because of Bitgrail, not because of XRB. Many of these people will want to buy back in, because they are still convinced of XRB.

He didn't even look at me and didn't respond, but he did move closer till we were shoulder to shoulder. Then he slid his left hand into my pocket and began to fondle my genitals. He never made eye contact. Just felt my balls and my stiffening shaft through the inside of my pocket until the elevator reached the ground floor. Paralyzed with fear and embarrassment, I didn't resist or push him away. The door opened and about ten Chinese businessmen were standing there looking at us, Sunny with his hand in my pocket, me with an erection. I didn't move. Sunny took his hand out, shamelessly licked his fingertips, and then walked out of the elevator. I still didn't move. The businessmen crowded in and I rode back up with them as a few of them cast sidelong glances at me and talked to each other in Chinese. I rode all the way to the top of the building, then back down again, just to make sure Sunny wasn't in the lobby waiting for me.\n",

For kids investing these days they think btc is just blocking them from getting rich by going down every now and then like it's a competition. other altcoins are dependent on btc more like a unit working together rises and drops all together, and absolutely unlike the analogies you provided. that will change when people see cryptos as different from btc, but that will aqbsolutely not change by btc dying, trust me.\n",

      "\n",
      "More on point, if you actually carefully read Page 10 and 11, volatility is ONLY mentioned in the context of \"hedging costs.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Currency hedging: Currency hedging can be costlier initially due to the need to hedge a new, potentially volatile asset. This model assumes hedging is five times costlier than with liquid fiat currencies at present. Hedging costs will improve over time as XRP liquidity increases. Not all banks may wish to hedge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this paper was written in February 2016, when Ripple was considering having banks actually physically holding XRP tokens on their balance sheet, thus requiring a discussion about hedging. However, NOW (well, since 2017), it has become clear that banks will probably never directly hold any XRP since regulations prohibit it. Rather, the XRP will probably be held by 3rd party liquidiy providers or non-banking subsiaries/affiliates. In such case, the hedging discussion goes out the window and the sole reason we were concerned about volatility (Hedging costs) goes out the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you are truly ignorant, the reason why banks MAY WANT to hedge (in the unlikely scenario they actually hold XRP tokens directly), is because banks don't like volatility in their assets, and would likely hedge any violatility in their directly held XRPs through other financial instruments, thus resulting in hedging costs. Of course as I already stated, bnaks aren't holding XRP directly, so there is no need to even consider hedging or volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in terms of volatility in XRP for the xRapid use case, again, that doesn't matter at all because the conversion price between fiat and XRP is locked in at both ends of the transaction. This is illustrated on ripple's website in both written form and diagram, in case it wasn't clear enough. So whether XRP costs $1.00 or $1,000,000 a token, the ratio is locked in at the moment the transaciton is finalized so it doesn't matter.\n",

These are all playing a major factors and most people I feel are naive about the crypto market and that it\\u2019s not being manipulated. With all of the negatives out there it's driving prices down. People manipulating the market are a huge underlying problem that I don't really see a lot of people discussing. I mean I get it is the wild west out here and if you get caught with a few bags it's see you fucking later. \\n\\nSo beware. Obviously. \\n\\nBut on a positive note for the longevity and larger exposure for crypto as a whole more companies especially at the local level are adopting payments for bch ltc eth -etc. Which is great. Also Robinhood is going to launch thier crypto side in February. 1M waiting list as of yesterday. Fee-less trading.... I think we all know how huge that is. As well as some larger exchanges in India and others adding more coins. \\n\\nSo take advantage of the dip and when these scams hit and exchanges shut down. I believe Things will settle and add a new floor within 3-4 weeks. \\n\\nAlso with Robinhood is going to bring much needed competition to drive these exchanges to compete and closer margins otherwise they'll lose everyone. I think that's what we saw with gdax and coinbase being off by a hundred or two difference in trading compared to other exchanges this past weekend. Trying to keep everyone buying there and hold onto the customers as long as possible til Robinhood shows up. \\n\\nEither way I expect a significant jump mid February. \\n\\n\\nTake what you will but just thought I'd share my two cents. \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Every generation has been wrong (so far). But in no other asset class that I am aware of has there been the HODL mentality that we have in crypto. This is important. There is a stubborn and bloody-minded 'fuck you' attitude in crypto that has created a community that holds through storm(s).\\n\\nThis psychology comes from different places. Partly it is anti-establishment. Partly it comes from a knowledge of how systemically corrupt the legacy financial system is, and that it is designed to exclude the vast majority of us from wealth-creation opportunities. Partly it is the love of the tech. Partly it is a confidence that blockchain will fundamentally change the world. All of these components link to create a resilience that can shield crypto from the type of short-termism that has worsened and lengthened previous asset-class collapses.\\n\\nAgain - this is important. It feels like we have the opportunity to break the shackles that previous generations have been held down by.

It appears to be a legitimate, but low-budget hobby project of volunteers. Apparantly a bunch of people in California spending their spare time on making the 'eco-friendly' coin sort of. Their website and whitepaper is seriously lacking, and there is absolutely no logical reason or evidence that this will be a massive gainer anytime this decade, and they even say so themselves. (Open and upfront at least huh?)\\n\\nBUT, my GF's name is Mint and her lucky number is 22. So I've taken a ~5% position of my portfolio in it with an exit target at 22 cents, which would require the coin to do like a 240x from where it's currently sitting at 8 satoshis, and take it to over a $4 billion marketcap which would make absolutely no sense for a project like this. (Though I guess doge/pac/dcn have shown us stranger things may happen)\\n\\nThere is apparantly a whitepaper and reworked website coming somewhere down the road but there's no dates and not a very active social media profile for it - but maybe it can go up a little bit - I'll have to hodl regardless though because I promised her on the odd chance it hits my crazy target I'm buying her a Chanel purse of her choice and a Tesla Model 3 haha.\\n\\nJust wanted to share my nonsense pick here since the market is dead and everyone is just freaking out over XRB today anyways - did anyone else do something like this and take a position in a crazy coin? Or have you perhaps also invested in Mintcoin?\\n\\nPlease share with me your nonsense picks, and the story behind why you picked them :P \\n\\nPS: I also put $20 in each of Slothcoin and Penguincoin for the luls - I know they're scams, and can't even be traded rn because Cryptopias LTC market is gone but it just somehow amuses me to be a 'millionaire' in Sloths and Penguins, two of my favourite animals.\",\n",

As more people become drawn into this idea of buying random coins as a way to make money, these coins become heavily overvalued for what they intend to do. That's why there's always speculation that we're in a bubble, because at the moment there is not a single coin that is being used for its intended purpose that matches the current price of it besides ETH/BTC I suppose. We could be in a huge bubble until all these cryptos are at a point where they are no longer speculative and actually do something that matches their value, or on the other hand we're just simply early investors.\",\n",

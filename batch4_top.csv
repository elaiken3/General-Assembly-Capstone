We're looking to publish an article every week starting in a few days focusing on a coin outside the top 50 and assessing the Whitepaper, the team, and the longevity of the project. This isn't meant to be helpful for day-traders, but more newbies looking for long-term coins to hold.

Do you guys reckon there's much of a market for this kind of work? It seems the biggest crypto followings are for Day-traders, but we're just nerds wanting to write about stuff we're reading anyway.

EDIT:

Thanks for the support on this! We're drafting something now, and I'll send people in this comment chain a reminder when we push it out.",0.92,daily_general_discussion_december_27_2017,0.0,0.895,0.105

5,"My recent analysis of the whole Verge fiasco as an outsider. For the past few days the XVG market had been manipulated to bleed out the unknowing investors. Prop up the price to around 1200-1300, once the target is hit, it is dumped almost immediately to below 1000. Dangle the ""Wraith protocol"" to prop up the price to 1200ish again, dump it and rinse and repeat. Each of these mini pump and dumps earn these scammers 20-30% gains, which are paid in blood and sweat by the rest. Once this so called ""Wraith"" is not released before the end of 2017, which I bet my life that it will not; or if it is, it will just be some random copy paste codes which cannot withstand peer reviews, the whole thing will come tumbling down.

With the end of 2017 coming and no other way of prolonging the eventual reckoning, John Mcafee tweeted about his change in position to prevent future lawsuits once this coin is being exposed. 4 more days to reckoning. Those who took mortgage/borrowed money/used your student loans, get out while you can. Any time the whales decided they have earned enough and stopped propping up the price at 1000, its all over.

Another red flag, the so called ""verge whale"" again dangling ""Wraith protocol""  https://twitter.com/XVGWhale/status/946052651543859201 with a picture of a luxurious car with no substance, no evidence, no nothing....",-0.9638,daily_general_discussion_december_27_2017,0.112,0.874,0.014

15,"Just going to lay out some facts. Interpret it how you wish. 


Enigma (ENG) has more trade volume per day than Augur, Golem, SALT, Status, Walton, Ark, Vertcoin, and, BAT, yet has 1/5th of the market cap of Augur, 1/4 market cap of Golem, and 1/4 of Ark (for example).


There is a huge amount of attention on this crypto, and there is a large disconnect between it's current price ($2.20) and its daily trade volume and market cap.


Enigma is a privacy protocol which is being built to layer on top of existing platforms (Ethereum to start with, but more to come later) for secret encrypted smart contracts for when there are use cases for it (medical records, confidential financial data, etc). A DAPP which requires privacy/secrecy for whatever reason, will be able to be built within Enigma, which encrypts the contents of its smart contract, and then feeds it to the Ethereum blockchain which will process it. Eventually there will be many more platforms/blockchains supported. Enigma aren't seeking to replace any platform but rather partner with them to deploy their privacy layer on top to add more value and address further untapped multi billion dollar markets. It's important to understand there are several use cases where blockchain would revolutionize certain industries, but they cannot utilize current platforms due to the open transparent nature of the blockchain. Enigma will close this gap in the market. Note: Enigma (ENG) are tokens for the ENG platform, it is NOT a coin like Monero. ENG will eventually enable staking on the Enigma platform if you own enough tokens (amount to be confirmed). Note that Enigma currently has no competitors in its field for the problems they are solving. The team are highly skilled guys at MIT and after you read the whitepaper, it would be extremely challenging to try copy their ideas, since you would need equal calibre people behind the scenes.


My opinion (disregard if you wish): Although I own some Enigma and am adding more daily, this should be valued around $8-11 (and that's just the beginning), certainly not $2.20. Whales are accumulating now.  I believe we will see them shine in 2018 and honestly, dominate the shit out of the riff raff in the Top 15-30 cryptocurrencies which I believe will happen quickly, and then in time, solidify its place within the Top 10.  I will be hodling ENG for all of 2018 and likely many more years after that, and am looking forward to it reaching double digits, which is usually the point at which the crowd finally starts paying attention to a crypto. We'll then see its true potential come to fruition.


As always i would strongly recommend you check it out more for yourselves before you invest. Their subreddit is r/enigmacatalyst  (catalyst is the name of the first of many DAPPs to be run on the enigma platform), and their site is enigma.co   where you can read the whitepaper.

So are my options to keep in Coinbase and wait/hope MN supports GDAX (no way of knowing if/when), or bite the bullet and pay the transfer fees? I have a pretty low amount in Coinbase, so I'm tempted to just wait so fees don't eat away my minimal/non-existent gains.

I've not been able to access or fully verify any of my accounts for a while now.

I've had a Bittrex account since 2014 but only accessed it sporadically. A few months ago I logged in and discovered it had been disabled. I went through the reactivation process but no change. I emailed support and got a notification saying the problem had been fixed, but it wasn't -the account was still deactivated. I've now gone through this process another 2 times now - the latest attempt was several weeks ago and I have not heard anything from Bittrex (guess they're super busy).

Around the same time I also signed up to Coinbase. This too is stuck in the Verification stage. I've tried to verify my account several times but the site seems to just hang when uploading my ID. Lodged a support ticket, no responses. (I also tried Gemini, but it's not yet available in my country).

I've been researching Crypto for a couple months now and finally decided to invest some money.

Building my portfolio is still a work in progress at the moment. Waiting for funds to transfer and getting set up on the different exchanges has been a bit more time consuming than I thought!

Here's what I'm looking at right now.

XRB - 30%
BTC - 15%
ETH - 15%
IOTA - 15%
XRP - 15%
XMR - 10%

Does this seem like a solid portfolio? 

I'd appreciate any input/advice.

Dash/EOS 2%,
IOTA 3%, 
Monero 1%, 
Ripple 1%

As you can see, I am coming from being a beginner on Coinbase and investing mostly into safe coins. But I'd like to taste more of the ""10x-50x""-madness with smaller coins. What parameters would you readjust, what coin would you use to convert into smaller ones and how much of it? What to buy? New money is not possible, I just have my few $ for gambling. So thats why I'd like to readjust. Also NAV Coin, Request network look promising, unfortunately I don't have an account for getting XRB.
And another question: Where to convert? When I use my new EXODUS account for converting LTC to ETH (for swapping it at Binance) the fees are approx 10% which sounds crazy high. Any ideas? 
Help would be appreciated. :)

After observing a lot of different conversations over the last couple month the two ends of the moral, and potential profitability, spectrum seems to be these:

1.) Coins that will survive or are best prepared for potential regulation because they are associated with banks or centralized in someway 

and 2.) Completely anonymous coins that are very decentralized will obviously carry the potential to be used for illegal workings because of the anonymous nature and will skirt regulation as long as possible.

So my question for conversation is this. What’s your strategy around these two ends? I am trying to build a portfolio around both of these at the same time knowing one will most likely cannibalize the other at some point. Or maybe if I am lucky both will have a great value in the future because the serve such opposite, but balancing, existing markets.

647,"Ok fellas, let me share in my turn my thoughts on a coin i believe in. MCO coin --> https://mona.co/

Why is Monaco (MCO) so undervalued ?

* They have a real product (their credit/debit card) which can make up 2% cashback thanks to their MCO coin.
* Possibility to pay with the card and withdraw on ATM with NO fees at all and with best market price
* It will be functionning with both BTC and ETH at launch (and of course MCO), and the withdraw will be done with the best real time market price (Oh ! i alredy said that).
* The card is completly free !

What I think, the Monaco card will resolve a huge problem. When it comes to withdraw the funds, everyone is strugling at it, with the MCO card you know you can get with no fees your BTC/ETH/MCO coins in no time. You can also use for store purchases.

I think that the MCO coin will go up when people will realise that.

PS : I'm also sharing this to be challenged on it. May be other investors see weakness i can't see.

3. They aim to be the ""Google for blockchain"" and also app store for decentralized applications.

4. They are listed on very few obscure exchanges and yet their volume has reached 30m. This is huge if you compare it with RaiBlocks 24h volume.

5. Their main net is going to be released end of Q1 2018. Testnet by end of 2017.

6. More exchanges are going to list it in January. So this is similar to ICON and XRB.

7. It's hidden from coinmarketcap.com right now, similar to how ICON was hidden for a while. And when icon got listed, it suddenly appeared out of nowhere in the top 20.

729,"-- Subject  : $ZCL and future Bitcoin Private Hardfork --

Hi guys, did you see the $ZCL Resurgence over 165k sats as it prepares for an Upcoming Hardfork. Indeed people will get 1 Bitcoin Private (ZCL Rebranded) per 1 ZCL.

I don't especially like brand heist, however it's the first time we will read about a Private 'Bitcoin' and I think it could be a huge deal on the market. 

ZCL is the first fork of Zcash. Runing the zerocash (privacy) protocol, ZCL is similar as Zcash without the 20% founder's rewards when mining, which makes it a better more decentralied coin. 

ZCL is still currently under 50M market cap. 
When you see projects like $ADA sitting at 10B without ANY actual product. I have no difficulties believing ZCL could easily reach 1B even without the BTCP rebranding. After the hardfork it could reach 2-3B easy I think (which is still only half of the market cap of Monero for instance).

If you want more information : https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/the-resurgence-of-zcl-and-an-upcoming-hardfork-3ba65de3cf21

Thinking of calling it WPOTD (white paper of the day) though it would likely only be like twice a week. 

Here is what I'm thinking. 

Information is one of the most important things when it comes to investing in this market. 

I've only been around the game for about 1.5 months, only started investing 2 weeks ago. But I love reading up on the new tech and white papers. I'm constantly trying to educate myself. 

So I thought, why not write a short write up on things I find interesting about the cryptos that I am looking at and researching? I can break down their white paper, link to their site and other projects and give my opinion. 

It would also be a chance for everyone else to jump in and discuss the project, give their opinions, etc. 

THIS WOULD NOT BE A SHILLING TYPE THING. 

I would randomly pick one from Binance with a generator online and just dive right in. 

I think this could be really great, especially for people looking for information and new people coming into this market.

746,"So I've been seeing a lot of people in here ask for advice about a coin or maybe more general question about what has potential and people jump on them to do their own research. Isn't this apart of the research process? Asking a community of people who know more? I understand that it opens the flood gates for people to shill their own coin but at the same time, what's bad about asking for some coins to research? There's literally thousands of coins out there and as someone who is new to the game, why is it looked down upon to reach out to more knowledgable people? Isn't that what the community is for? Learn from each other? If Joe Somebody asks what would be a good investment and 10 people respond with 10 different coins, now he's gone from 3000+ coins to research down to 10. And if Joe doesn't like those 10, then he can look for more but I just don't understand why it's so bad to reach out and ask people what they think is good? And who cares if shilling happens? I really don't understand what's so bad about that? I've read many a shill and enjoyed to read the positives of that project. I didn't invest in most (although I wished I did on some of them) but hearing more than what the white paper offers was informational.

Another thing that irks me is when someone posts, ""This coin is going to take off but I'm not going to spoon feed you, DYOR."" How about you tell us why YOU think it's going to do well. Everyone processes this information differently so while someone will read a white paper and say, ""Oh wow, so much potential."" Someone else might think that it's nothing more than a niche coin that won't take off. Maybe they don't see the larger picture. Maybe they're not understanding the full potential of a coin. Help them out.

Instead of getting mad at people who are reaching out to a community literally just for cryptocurrency, why not share with them what you've learned because in the end, that's how cryptos will succeed. It's still black magic for the majority of the world which makes them weary about it all and until people explain what these thousands of different projects do and how they can help in a more simple way, people will continue to be weary about it all. So get off your high horse and just help out your fellow crypto enthusiast (and not so enthusiast) understand everything.

823,"I am new to Reddit and posted this to a long post on the **SNOV coin (Snovio)** -- I don't have enough karma or whatever, so I'll just post it here so I don't feel like I wasted 20 minutes of my life.

For anyone interested, I know the lead gen space VERY well, and this is my 2 cents.

1. One thing that is not clearly defined on the sales page (which is odd to me because this is a MAJOR expense for my clients) is the ability to scrub data that you already have on opt-i. In other words, if you are running a form fill campaign (lander), you normally have opt-in based on whatever your T&C's are on the onClick, it usually makes sense to scrub data prior to campaign pushing simply because sendgrid/mailchip/mailgun/whoever (whether its a mail service or a campaign server), penalizes you for bounces. A CHEAP way to pre-scrub like this is a solid concept. Companies like NextCaller (etc) have high prices, and although they provide demographic data, there is still a 1/3 coverage rate, in addition to the fact that you don't get associated leads. Snovio does not appear to provide demog data, however you can check leads at 5 per penny. Even if the lead isn't in their DB, returning a null check, the reward of getting some coverage on common domains (ie: send checks only on the linked in stuff or well known domains) -- seems to me to be very valuable. So the income model can work.

2. Something I hope they expand on is making this more of an automated service with a post-response system that can scrub in real-time. This type of service can make for one hell of a circulating market where the posts can drop data into the system as targets (unverified, but still flagged as ""checked"") and responses that say in real time if it's verified or not. In other words, if I post 10,000 leads, they only have 1,000 listed, they could still store the other 9,000, award my clients partial points, and then later if those leads turn out to be verified, then the weighting on the leads could be considered higher simply because there would be a back trace of the lead being attempted previously. We do this constantly across clients and have build a very large database inside my client groups for this very purpose.

3. As to whether this requires blockchain... for the consumer facing stuff (their chrome extension) I can see this as a benefit because it creates incentive. However, for me, and I hope this is in their plans, the breakout will be if they can convince high volume lead generators like myself to do a ping/post system via API for email checks. In other words, if (as a partner), I qualified 500k leads in sporadic domains in email, and then another 500k in phone numbers, this data push into their system would help them rapidly gain traction and achieve more leverage in the buyer/seller market.

4. At LeadsCon, there is a constantly influx of companies looking to scrub and or fill-out their data. Working with lead gen companies to create fuller profiles is also something I hope is on the horizon here, as it would open this company to compete with NextCaller, YP, in the area of phone/email. **This is something that is going to happen whether it's snovio or whoever doing it.** -- Especially in the call space, which again I hope is on the horizon here.

5. No discredit to the above author, but $2 leads on form-fill is way out of context. **No one pays $2 for a email based lead that doesn't have opt-in, IP address, etc (except maybe extreme-niche industries like meso in the legal space or something like that)). However, demographic-ing a lead, or lead verification services CAN go for 3-5 cents a lead, and Snovio appears to be pulling this off for 1/10th of that price. That alone justifies the valid price points on their website (depending on lead coverage).**

SUMMARY: All that being said, there is a very solid amount of potential here, but for me, the big question is whether they can partner with lead producers and not rely solely on extension based stuff. I say this because lead producers (like me) do this for a living. I know first hand that the older a lead, the more likely you can get your ass handed to you through can-spam or dnc issues on new leads, and also the more likely you are to get cleaner data vs older data that has high kick-back rates (both in phone and email contact).

As both a seller of data and collector of data, I absolutely want to know how frequent a lead is checked in addition to the last verification date of that lead. And as a producer of data, I am able to deploy that information. Partnering with the a few dozen aggr's like myself could turn this entire thing into gold (in the lead gen space).

As to how that plays out with respect to valuation of a SNOV token, I have no clue whatsoever. I dabble in crypto, but I don't claim to be any type of oracle. However, I do try to only invest in stuff where I can (albeit remotely) see where there is a valid business concept around the coin/token. For me, it's almost like a ripple/stellar type of thing; I will be the first to admit that I still can't see how the market psychology of the coin value, but I can see that in the coins that do seem to break out (like those two) they do have valid business concepts behind it all (whether those businesses work remain to be seen I guess).

We will be integrating snovio into our platform over the coming weeks, so if anyone is interested in our experience feel free to post. I'm new to Reddit, but pretty active in the PHP community (specifically Laravel). As an integrator, I would like to hear from anyone else who might be integrating this platform.",0.9946,daily_general_discussion_december_26_2017,0.041,0.866,0.093

let’s say I had initially exchanged all my btc to alt. Would it be more beneficial, hypothetically, to move all the alts to btc during a rise?

In my head logically i think it doesn’t really matter as the satoshi value of the alts wouldn’t fluctuate enough for you to lose the btc value of them anyways. So in all the usd value of the alts would rise up while the btc does because of the projected satoshi value for each alt anyways. correct?

So, I guess I'll start with my history.  (I didn't learn as much from cryptokitties as I would have liked) 
I'm on the low end of the spectrum money wise.
I was using coinbase and trying to kind of trade in there watching the values. 
After doing more research, I've moved that idea to binance. I spread out quite a bit and have moved about 33% of my coins in something other than Eth. I've been looking at the coins in the top 20 market cap to decide what to buy. Then I look them up on reddit and see what kind of info I can see. Mostly if their subs are positive or shit postings. Then I do a google search and see if I find anything else that would raise any flags.
So I guess I'm not real sure what I'm looking for with the market cap. Cap, availability, and price along with news and reddit reputation is my current go to. But I'm fairly confident there should be more to it than that.
Whats a safe Hodl:trade ratio?

In my case this is ETH. My initial buys were when ETH was in the 2 digit to low 3 digits. The other day, there was a huge differential between two exchanges that I use. I ended up buying a buttload on the lower one and selling an equal amount on the higher one.

After reading into the whole taxing issue, am I shooting myself in the foot here? Due to first in first out, say I bought at 200 and sold at 700 and then immediately rebought at 650. Do the taxes on the 500$ “profit” outweigh the 50$ arbitrage profit?

I've got about $4k in crypto investments. I invested a total of $800 back in June this year, btc ltc and eth (now I have many more but those are the main three). 

With how btc has been going.. Would it be reasonable to pull all that out and reinvest in btc for pure monetary value?

1091,"OK Noob question but other newcomers may benefit from your answer:
Yesterday I was happy with the increase in my Alts and I am satisfied that they are good coins for the future and to hold. At one point I was 10% up on Satoshis but then papa BTC woke up all bullish and caused a mess because my portfolio did not include enough BTC (I have just 6% btc). The relative Alt price went down lots during the BTC spike. Now I am back to where I started with Sats and wondering if Alts are worth the trouble?
Is there any point in investing in Alts if they will be worth less Sats next year? Will the Alts keep up with BTC surges in 2018? I understand there's a lag but do they catch up completely? It seems that a BTC surge tears the connection with Alts, where a slow increase drags them up. A bit like towing a car, you have to increase speed slowly so not to snap the tow rope.
Should I have listened to Crypto Kirby and be holding at least 50% BTC in my portfolio, to minimize the Satoshi swing during surges?
I now view all Alt prices relative to BTC and ignore the $fiat value fluctuations, which seems unnatural thing to do but I must get it into my head that the name of the game is to use alts to increase my total sats.
Any advice from those with experience is appreciated. I expect I would get a different answer on this forum than if I asked on r/bitcoin, so any answers with numbers or facts regarding BTC effects on Alts would be appreciated.
I saw some people get downvoted for ditching their Alts yesterday. Was that by Alt purists and BTC haters or is that a valid strategy during this bull run. I have a chance to start from scratch since my sats are same as when I began.

I got significant free money from the Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Cash hard forks. So, knowing this is happening, I can't understand why anyone would be selling their BTC this week? It seems insane not to wait until the hard forks happen so the free coins can be harvested before selling.

This company is run by people within the UK and EU, but registered in UAE. It is not registered or licensed for financial trading or advice in the UK and EU, the very locations it is actively engaging in business and receiving money from.

They draw in clueless people who have heard of crypto and the potential to make money. The company has people deposit money, they then take a cut of this as a management fee and then say they buy coins with the remainder. The issue here is that whilst in the past few months we see the main coins and alts doing 5x or 10x, if not more. People who put their money into Easycryptopacks are mentioning below 2x results despite entering the market (or so they assumed) well before Oct/Nov.

Their Twitter account and Facebook reviews show people promoting and rating this company who are involved in ponzi schemes.

(I was told that this has been in effect for the last year or two, so that makes me think all these threads about needing to account for trades in taxes only needs to be done in 2018+ is a misleading/incorrect... of course how you deal with taxes is your own personal business.)

Trading alts effective is treated like stocks, where every transaction is a tax event since they are not considered like-kind assets. How easily this will be to moderate by the IRS I don’t know but I would expect severity to come as the market matures. Anyway, remember paying taxes is a positive thing for mankind and make sure you understand the potential impact of your trading decisions. For instance if you are doing moderate to high frequency trading to make use of crypto tax services online to make sure you’re as safe as possible!

* 5. Regulation is needed- bring it on. 
* 6. Buy on the red days, when prices are down. 
* 7. Security is key- Password manager and cold storage wallet is best
* 8. Don't listen to anyone, do your own research

1489,"Hi all! 

Relatively low investor here (total value under $1k) and I'm looking into wallet and exchange solutions. Ideally, I'd like to get my coins settled by the new year so that I can park them and watch. Obviously, low fees (especially on withdrawals as I don't do much trading) is a priority for me, but I have a few other considerations:

- I actually don't mind the idea of leaving my coin in an exchange or multi-sig provided that the company assumes liability for lost coin.
- Currently, I have almost all of my assets in the big Coinbase 3 (minus BCH) with the exception of a small amount of Ripple in Poloniex. I'd love to have them all in one place. 
- I'm definitely a fan of GDAX's free withdrawals and would love for that to remain an option, even if not necessarily through GDAX. 

So, do y'all have any suggestions of a good exchange and/or wallet that would allow for at least some of what I've outlined? I'm not excited about Poloniex but I don't mind it. I've got a Binance account as well with nothing in it yet, and I've heard both good and bad about it. As for wallets, is Coinbase's vault a good option?

That's pretty wild about about the rise of Reddcoin right now - over 100% up in value in the last 17 hours or so, due to a message that John McAfee sent out on Twitter. (What the big bag hodlers of Reddcoin and other cryptos are probably wondering right now: Where do I send him the crates of Tequila?)

I wrote a blog on Steemit (and my site) about it, and I'd add the links, but I don't have enough karma points, yet. So, when I do, I'll be posting more (but there should be a link in my profile).

I first discovered ENG when deciding to enter cc markets in October of this year. I spent two full weeks 3-6 hours a day assessing tokens and after that I came back to Enigma. It was tough decision as they were hacked at ICO which made me doubt the competency of the team, however they repaid all stolen funds out of their raise. This incident left the price very low- artificially low. In addition to this ENG have no ‘marketing’ to speak of. They have spent 100% of their time developing their platform and 0% time pumping it up. Finally, ENG was only available to transact on minor exchanges ie binance for most of its life so far.  For these reasons I believe ENG is a fraction of its potential price and I will be hodling... expecting more than 10x increases and yes, at sub $2 ENG looks incredibly good value to me.

2. Again the app/ service/ clever excel where i can track how my current portfolio is growing BUT with the added view of how much each of the coins are contributing to the overall profitability of the portfolio. It seems that most services just give you an UP and Down view with a general chart, but when you try and explore what are the biggest contributors, it doesn't seem so straightforward.

I tried setting up a Coinbase account however as I don't have valid ID I couldn't auto-validate my account so have been trying to get approved through emails. Sent off my birth certificate, utility bills etc and was told I would hear back from them in a few days. That was around a month ago so I've given up on Coinbase for now.
Started looking into a few different exchanges and literally every one I go on requires ID before being able to make any sort of deposit.
I've got a Binance account which I've got wallet codes for but no way of actually sending money to them
It's annoying me because I decided on 7 different cryptos to put money into and I've watched them all go up between 2-5x in the space of a month so it's starting to feel like I've missed the wave again.

I want to highlight that I am not asking for coins that have only made other decisons regarding tradeoffs (e.g. BTC vs BCH) but coins that have technical innovation that can improve scaling.

Here is my best understanding of some coins:
• LTC, BCH: no technical innovation, have just changed some parameters
• ‎ETH: worse scaling problems than Bitcoin, but are working on sharding to solve that problem
• ‎XMR: offers fungability, but with same scaling problems as Bitcoin, only slightly worse
• ‎IOTA: somehow has infinitie scaling, but is not decentralized, meaning it does not compete with Bitcoin

1820,"Why are we in crypto?  To change the world?  To get rich?  Maybe do both?  It's hard not to panic when your portfolio gets shredded in a matter of hours.  It's important to remember in the short term it's very dangerous to buy anything at its all time high.  People who got here before you want to take profits.  Whales entering the market are also learning how to do what whales do, eat the little fish.  So when you buy high and sell low you become the little fish.  Buying random sh1t coins that you heard about from some guy on the web is also a recipe for disaster (at least in the short term, and maybe the long)

Nothing in the crypto world is easy.  It takes education, discipline, & time.  If that 50% swing is bugging you, maybe just get out now.  If you really believe in the coins you're buying, than maybe it's time to double down?  Stop looking at the price, and go educate yourself.  Figure out what's really behind the things you're buying.  Maybe it's great, or maybe it's garbage.  How will you know if you don't understand  it?

1826,"Sadly, I do not have enough karma to open a thread, still I'd like to discuss this subject and learn something from the way more experienced users here, so I'll just put it into this, maybe someone feels like typing a few thoughts:

Dear everyone,

as markets go down a lot lately I am thinking about the question, when to cash out and how?
Next to a few cryptos, I've got an ETF plan and for this, its clear: Hodl until retirement or for buying a house, hodling for >10 years for sure.
But what about cryptos? What is your personal tactics? As long as I don't realize any gains its just theory. The goal, at least for me, should be converting coins to fiat and buying something off it, maybe put the money into a car, a bike or just spending it for sports/hobbys/whatever. But when? Do you cash out after doubling your entry? After factor three? Factor 10? Or do you cash out a few $ after every bull run to minimize your risk?
To be honest, I never had stocks or anything, also I've never been a trader. So I am curious about tactics, what might be smart? Of youre I'm just in with money that I could lose, but thats not the aim, right? 
Also, imho it gets more complicated with more coins. Started with three of them as a newby on coinbase, now I got about 10-15 coins with majority still in the coinbase-ones. For example, after the massive gains in Litecoin, I really thought about cashing this out - and it would have been smart, see decrease at the moment. 
In my country, after 1 year of hodling, you can avoid taxes - so that might be a smart thing to do. But then, it's completly unpredictable where the markets will be in a year. On the same level? At Mars? Close to zero?

So I would be happy about a small discussion about your personal tactics and how you handle the subject - just being curious. :)

I made a little spreadsheet, mostly aimed at people just getting into cryptocurrency. I've put an example in it, but basically it's your own personal ledger reminding you of what coins you have, where they are, how much you purchased them for, and how much they are worth now.

Once you've purchased something and filled in all the fields the only thing that will need updating will be the 'current price of coin / token' column.

Again, this is pretty basic, but I find it pretty useful. Download the Google Sheet as an Excel Spreadsheet or whatever and it's all yours. If you've got any suggestions feel free to let me know. :)

1981,"OK - Wokey - thanks, here it is:

So, there’s a reason I couldn’t get through CalcIII when in university. There is something fundamental that I’m missing when I calculate a currency conversion for making Limit orders:

Say XTC is trading at 9039USD or 15ETH and I want to buy it for 8437USD which, when I use cryptonator.com/converter at 22:00-UTC, it calculates 8437USD to be 14ETH.

So, I place a Limit Order for 14ETH at that time. One hour later (at 23:00-UTC) my order has been Filled at 14ETH.

But now - at 23:05-UTC - when I plug 14ETH into the calculator the USD value of my XTC is 8395USD - not my intended goal of 8437USD - or 42USD less.

I know there is something seriously wrong (e.g.: dumb) here (along with my thought process) - and its to do with the Exchange Rates of the USD to ETH; and its fluctuations over time.

Can anyone help and/or point me to the answers and the basic theory that I’m missing? Thanks.

Currently it looks like this; 61% LTC, 12.5% XRP, 10% BTC, 6.5% REQ, 5.3% XLM, 4.2% LEND

I got in on LTC about a month ago and have made nice gains which is also why it is the majority of my portfolio.

Assuming we want to maintain 30-50% growth a month, what would you guys recommend? I'd be administering the fund, so I'm a wee bit nervous, but excited. I'm planning on allocating about 5-10% for long-shot currencies/day trading and leaving the rest in an Exodus wallet and shifting via shapeshift a few times a month depending on what's trending/bullish.

2253,"Do you want to know, why the cryptocurrency space is no bubble and why it‘s different from the new economy or real estate bubble? Because new economy stocks and houses were bought with secured loans. Loans secured with the very same asset! Banks gave you money if you used your stocks or your house(s) as a security. With that money people bought even more stocks or houses. The problem with that is the following: If the price drops for some reason, the value of your security drops and the banks will force the debtors to sell their stocks or houses. When people sell their assets it will push the prices even further down - resulting again in a lower value of securities. A downward spiral - that‘s the real popping of the bubble!

Now think about cryptos - right now, no bank on the planet will accept cryptos as security. So if the price of cryptos drop, noone is forced to sell their coins. The current price peak is not backed by loans based on cryptos as a security!

2311,"A few thought for people new to crypto.  

Security is the name of the game.   It's very easy to have all your crypto disappear overnight.  You don't own your crypto, unless you own the private keys.  What does that mean?  If you're storing your crypto on an exchange, you don't own your private keys.  Don't use a web wallet or app wallet that doesn't give you the private keys.  Basically your private keys prove you own that address/wallet/coin/crypto.  

What do your private keys do for you?  They allow you to use your crypto whenever you want.  If all your crypto is on an exchange and your account gets locked guess what?  You lose your coins.  What if the exchange gets hacked?  You lose your coins.  This stuff happens.  Mtgox, Nicehash ext.  When your crypto is on an exchange the exchange owns the keys, hence your crypto.  

Your keys are god, treat them better than your child.  If you lose them, you're screwed.   Do not neglect them.  Have them stored on a hard drive, and it goes bad?  Sorry you lose.  Have them stored in a paper wallet and it gets destroyed 5 years down the road?  Sorry you're screwed.  Your hardware wallet glitches out, or gets lost?  Screwed.  

So if you're going to keep part of your holdings in cold storage (not connected to the internet) or in a wallet that provides the keys; make darn sure you don't lose those keys.  Make multiple backups.  As the saying goes 1 is none.  And keeping your backup in the same place as the original is the same as having none.  

Just a few thoughts off the top of my head.  I am no security expert.  Just a guy with a new account.  If you don't know what any of this means, you need to learn about it.  It does you no good if you make all kinds of gains, and lose all your coins to some hacker.

As most people probably know, beginning on 1/1/18, crypto exchanges will no longer be considered tax-exempt *like-kind* exchanges.  I'm still fuzzy on this, but I believe this means that if you buy 1 BTC at $5,000 and it raises to $15,000, at which point you convert it to ETH, you will be required to pay taxes on that $10,000 appreciation.


**So... my question:**

For US residents, what is your strategy?  I was thinking of solidifying my Altcoin positions prior to the new year and then just riding out the market for the future until I eventually (if ever) convert some back into fiat.  I'm not even sure how that will be calculated for taxes, but I am assuming I would just calculate the percentage of my portfolio I am cashing out, and figure out the corresponding percentage of my initial fiat investment, and report taxes on the diference.

A Newbie question, after the weeks of research, I've got some ETH yesterday.
Now i am dividing them into different cryptos as follows:

15% NEO

The investment time is supposed to be up to Q1/Q2 2018.

**In Blockfolio is there a way to specify Time of a transaction more than just date**? I have a few day trades on stuff from early on, some of which happened on the same day. Blockfolio isn't organizing the same day transactions in the order I entered them. Some sell orders are showing up after my buy orders, so my unintentional sell low/buy high strategy isn't properly reflected.

~~In Delta the prices it shows on the Transaction history are different than what I entered. Yet if I go into the details to check, the correct purchase price is there. For example I purchased 0.05067556 BTC @ $7,049.49, but it shows $6,972.65 on the page that lists out all the transactions. Delta does allow you to specify a purchase time (which is awesome and my problem with Blockfolio).~~

EDIT: /u/keithkman made me double check I was entering the correct exchange for my transactions. That fixed my Delta problem.

Also, and this is for both apps, how can I enter a transfer from my account on one exchange to my account on another exchange (that then got turned into Alt coins). So I didn't really sell or buy, I just transferred the money.

Marketcap is only ~$60 million right now. It has a very low supply, and it has the same aggressive emission that Monero does, meaning block rewards will quickly decrease in the next year or so.

Right now, Aeon is waiting for the rebase to come, as its development is done almost exclusively by one Monero core developer. It also lacks a GUI as wallets are still command line.

It's obviously not all wins, but I'm still up big time from 6 months ago. It's been such a blast trying to figure out which tokens are going to be worth something and which aren't. Which is probably why I'm looking into ICO's in the first place.

My friends and I have turned it into a sort of game. We're competing to find the best ICO's and effectively betting against each other. It was during this time I found an ICO that wants to build on betting on cryptocurrencies. It's called Ethorse, and it's what I'm betting on to do well because I've seen first hand how fun it can be to compete with friends while making money.

1) It's in part a direct consequence of the Bitcoincash bullshit on Coinbase. And good. Glad it didn't just go unnoticed, glad it didn't go without consequence.

2) Unless this really is the bubble popping, it's good to have this kind of downturn intermittently. I'd be getting freaked if the last month's growth continued basically unhindered for another month. (Granted wed all be making a lot of money in that case)

3) Recovery from could be a good stress test for the market at current trading levels.

4) A significant dip and then recovery hasn't occurred since cryptos really entered mainstream and attracted so many novice. If this recovers well it should improve market confidence in the end and lowers bubble fear.

2887,"Morning Update:

Well, two big nasty updates for the day...  

First, obviously is the BTC dip.  As many suspected, a combo of the new tax bill + shorts in the futures market are causing BTC to dip pretty hard.  I saw it go as low as mid 12k last night.  Throw in fear selling, and stop loss sells, and we have the makings of a major crash.  However, that being said, its when everything looks bleak, that the whales come in and prey on the weak handers.  So, the worse it looks, and the more fear there is (IE - Blood in the water), the more sharks come out to feed.  BTC will recover.

Second big crap sandwich is the standard Friday sell off.  When are all the day / week traders going to stop doing this?  It gets annoying, every single  damn week we dip hard when everyone sells their alts on Friday.  Since this was expected, I cashed out of most of my alts yesterday.  My advice is to watch the coins you are interested in very very closely.  Wait for the low point, and scoop up as much as you can.  Usually between Friday / Sunday.  However, with the holidays coming up next week, its a little unpredictable.  Use your best judgement.

As for me, I am holding my BTC and waiting.  I have a couple shitcoins that I scooped up this week for low prices, and they are holding up pretty well.  I will just hold them till they hit the sell prices I set, even if it takes weeks.  I've currently got my eye on a couple coins that I can't wait to buy at certain prices.  

Well, that's it.  Im probably going to be offline for the most part until after the 25th.  So, good luck to all, stay safe, warm, and have a happy Cryptomass!

Am I using Bitcoin wrong?

I got a small amount of bitcoin and I tried to make a purchase on Newegg.com.

I watched the clock tick down 15 minutes and the invoice expired because the payment wasn't confirmed.

I cancelled my order. Then I got an email from bitpay saying I underpaid. I don't see how, since I used the link on newegg and it filled out the form for me.

Bitpay told me I had to claim my refund, so I put in my address and they said they are refunding me 0.016

SO, I just lost 0.006 BTC and a bunch of time, and I got nothing to show for it.

The hardest part of crypto is trading a coin that fluctuates wildly into another coin that is also fluctuating wildly. If i want OMG(good coin) but I only have wabi (another goodie), I have to trade OMG to bitcoin to wabi. Takes too long and I have to think about bitcoin's price.

Or if I want to take my USD from my bank account - I have to buy a wildly fluctating coin, wait 10 days, and hope i start off even.

Being a crypto noob I could really use some guidance/instruction.

3268,"So I got interested in BitCoin a few monts ago when it was around 600€ each and I found the concept of blockchain and cryptocurrencies very interesting. Even thought of investing some money but finally didn't (now I regret). 
Two weeks ago cryptocurrencies got my attention again and thought that this time I couldn't miss the chance and I wanted to invest 100€ in Ripple to see what happens. And I started to find some complications.

To buy Ripple you can only do it from a few wallets that they tell you in the Ripple website. So, I investigated a little and found that the only one that was more or less trustable (and with low fees) was Bitstamp. I tried to make an account but it's been more than a week and the account hasn't been validated yet.

After that I started too look at other cryptocurrencies and wallets and found that if you want to buy Bitcoin you can find thousands of wallets (not all of them trustable, and not all of them with acceptable fees), but if you want to buy other cryptocurrencies you will most likely need to have 2, 3 or even more different wallets. And if you want to traspass money from one to another both parts will charge you with fees.

So, isn't it a bit hard to invest in cryptocurrencies? Half of the wallets are not trustable, the other half have high fees. The few ones that are trustable and have small fees are really slow, and you can only buy some cryptocurrencies with them. 

This are the impressions of a really noob random dude with 0 knowledge about cryptocurrencies, economics or whatsoever.

Any advise on how to invest in a not-so-complicated way and trustable?

Yet another question; my intention hasn't been at any point to invest in a short term, but if I would I think that's kinda hard too if a transaction can take hours or even days...

If some of you guys can provide any website for noobs about economics or cryptocurrencies that could help me understand this world a bit deeper I would be really thankfull.

3316,"With bitcoin taking a crash at the moment people need to ask themselves why, and who is responsible.

Theres no short answer for this. The honest truth is the community and developers behind this on social media spur alot of the problems. 

We saw both bitcoin and bitcoin cash on a constant uprise and positive news reports all month. 

So what happened? 

Was inisder trading involved? Coinbase? No. The people following them that were screaming to crash bitcoin cash. The ones supporting Roger Ver screaming to sell bitcoin and only buy Bitcoin Cash. Each side calling the others a scam. Each side hoping to crash the other and their side to go up. 

I saw numerous reports of people urging others to sell out all their bitcoin cash and crash the market because Roger Ver did insider trading with coinbase etc. 

What the public sees is ""Bitcoin is a scam"" ""Sell all your bitcoins"" ""coinbase is a scam"" ""Bitcoin is crashing"". So now what the media posts is the same thing.

This is further complicated by people that dont know how order books work making instant sells and buys. 

Will it ever go back up? Yes. But the community needs to change for it to stay up and start being more positive on a whole. Will the new investors get back in? Most probably wont.",-0.8924,daily_general_discussion_december_22_2017,0.137,0.771,0.092

Despite my jokes in my introductions I placed serious questions. I'm not trying to join the community for the memes, I'm trying to join so I can ask questions and learn more. I couldn't do this before because I worked too many hours to do anything besides sleep.

I hold nem and etherium, as I am interested and believe in smart contracts a lot more than decentralized currency. It would be good to gain some karma so I can ask some practical business questions on here about said smart contracts and participate in existing and tolerated meme banter when appropriate.

http://www.ub.com/project/get - Phase 2 doesn't contain too much information

I interpret it as follows:

My BTCs are currently on paper wallet, so I have to do the following steps:

     1. Get a transaction ID

a) send additonal 0.0001 BTCs to my paper wallet

b) import (not sweep) the paper wallet to e.g. Jaxx and send 0.0001 BTC to my paper wallet address itself

     2. send the tx ID from the 0.0001 BTC transfer to UB.com https://www.ub.com/claimubtc

and then: wait for response? Will they email me back?
Anyhow I'd move BTCs to another paper wallet before I import the other private key to the UB.com wallet

What's not clear for me: Eligibility: The receiving address.. must be used as one of the sending (input) addresses. Does this mean I need to have an outgoing TX from my paper wallet prior to block height #501878?

3440,"Countless folks throughout the world have recently become enamored with both cryptocurrency speculation and the incredible potential of the underlying blockchain technology.

I'd be really interested in hearing opinions from this community about the recent price action in Ether & the other major cryptocurrencies. What are your thoughts and feelings right now?

My opinion (as someone new around here) is that everything I have seen over the last few weeks has been an absolute blessing for anyone that's here for the long haul. Bitcoin, Ether, the concept of cryptocurrency, and at least the word “blockchain” are all becoming more mainstream every single day. The facemelting gains realized by speculators this year have absolutely helped gather attention.

That being said, not all attention is good attention. And not all cryptocurrencies (or blockchain projects) are worth a damn. Money has been flowing in faster than questions have been answered. Some projects may be highly overvalued & many people are suggesting that the entire market may have gotten at least a bit ahead of itself in the short-term.

But... I'm not really here for the short-term. I'm very conservative & skeptical when it comes to new investments and I don't like to rush into buying anything that feels extremely expensive at the time or that I know very little about. Between the combination of having that mentality & the extremely fun ;) process of verifying my identity with an exchange I have only invested a very, very small amount of the capital that I have allocated for crypto investments. 

So... basically... I see this as the beginning (hopefully) of a much needed good buying opportunity. I want ETH to get cheaper. Significantly cheaper. So I can get more of it.

I feel this way because I believe in the long-term prospects of the Ethereum Network. I am excited to see how POS impacts the price & behavior of Ether. I'm excited to see how the various ideas for scaling end up coming together. I'm excited to see all sorts of applications being built & deployed on the Ethereum Network (requiring more & more gas every day). And, most of all, I'm excited to be a part of that whole journey with all of you & an owner of Ether. Even if it's not very much.

I intended to post this directly in the ethtrader sub, but I guess I can't because my account is super new. Anyway! Anyone else have something to say? :)

3577,"Hey fellow cryptonians. Been lurking a while and now I feel it's time to share my experience in all of this madness. I started trading about 3 weeks ago and and turned 3k into about 7k in about 10 diff alt coins (not taking any significant profit out yet, just $400 when my car got towed lol). Then December 18-19th came. Still gaining like crazy. Oh shit Bitcoin cash. WTF is that?? Why is it up $4000 higher in coinbase than binance. I better buy in binance before it catches up to coinbase price!!! *looking for BCH in binance for a solid hour* fuck. BCH is BCC in binance. Ok by this time BCC is 5k in binance. Sell everything buy BCC in a panic at a price. Hmmm now BCC is dropping faster than I've seen anything in this market move. Awesome lost all my gains and was sitting about even. Sold BCC at about 3.3k. A few days later now all my initial investments are down about 1k. Sitting on 2k and currently dropping. 

So today I decided to invest in a trading bot that gurantees 1% return every 4 hrs. Comes out to 180% return every 30 days. Anyone have experience with these things? Just found out about them after doing more research on the covesting.io comment page.

Oh yeah I also invested about $1200 in covesting's ICO about three days ago...well I meant to. Accidentally sent about 900 from binance to the covesting ico wallet address instead of going through an erc20 wallet first. Spoke with the COO of the company. He's a nice guy told me my transaction is in the block chain and there's nothing he can really do. So according to him now I have to hope that binance will 1. Send me my COV tokens or 2. Add COV to the exchange platform and it will just show up in my account... Anyone know if this is accurate? Are these only options or is my money gone?

So anyways... sorry if you read all that. Just wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else road this wave in a similar  fashion. Gonna continue to HODL and hope these other investments work out. Feedback appreciated!

I have a question though.

As someone who wishes to open a business, which for conveniences sake, let's call Fedora construction, as it's a construction company, which hopefully can expand into an engineering firm in the future, how could smart contracts be implemented to help me make money? I'm honest, I'm only here so I can learn ways to make money, either from trading or using block chain tech, and since this is all in the realm of business, I think there is nothing wrong with some greed!

How is a smart contract better than a custom set up computer IT scheduling and ordering system? What incentive exists to prefer block chain? I have spent 3 months reading and cannot understand fully.

I would like to invest in the coin that offers me that golden incentive.

3727,"ETH is the safest big cap coin right now.

I'm honestly worried at the bubble behaviour in other markets (and yes this effects ETH albeit to a lesser degree IMO as it has already performed exceedingly well in Q1-2 2017 on the back of actual global adoption). I really hope those getting involved elsewhere are taking short term trader mentalities rather than investing.

The big red flag for me is seeing XRP hit >$1; this money is super dumb (XRP shares = great, XRP token = not so hot) and I'm not in the business of chasing FOMO in dumb money.

I've moved very little in the last 6 months at great opportunity cost (EOS, BTC, MKR and a select few others give me some regret) but at the same time I believe the markets will eventually consolidate into quality projects; even if that means a significant correction across the board.

...

**Note the following:** 

The next year looks incredible for ETH in terms of liquidity and economics; 

- Increasing public awareness (network effect catch up + public educating themselves better).

- PoS implementation very likely (passive income for a growing non-speculative potentially essential asset will appeal to institutional investors + this will reduce inflation and lead to massive supply lockup on a background of increasing demand for ETH/gas).

- Sharding/working scalability solutions (both on/off chain) will likely mature with further deployments.

- dAPP releases.

- Ethfinex and decentralized exchanges running on ETH will encourage growth/pumps in ETH and it's ecosystem of ERC20 tokens; these are in ETHfinex's best interests after all to see the market grow and if you believe the tether rumours (I do) I don't see why this won't happen.

- The potential impact of DAI stable coins in causing ETH to be locked up by the makerDAO (liquidity squeeze combined with PoS will dramatically reduce circulating ETH supply). The potential demand for stablecoins is massive especially in jurisdictions such as the UK where you aren't taxed per trade but on conversion to fiat only. 

- Thus even in a large scale market wide correction; I struggle to see ETH being undervalued for very long; if anything we are just getting started. For me that makes selling very difficult ***even on 8000% appreciation in under 2 years.***

&nbsp;

I cannot stress that cryptocurrency trading provides the kind of accessibility, volatility and returns to the middle classes that stocks, savings, bonds and other more traditional financial instruments cannot provide. In the UK health service we are bitter over years of effective pay cuts, assaults on our pension plan (devaluations, changing goal posts), media campaigns that have attempted to discredit our worth and professional standing, GBP devaluation and near zero percent interest rates on savings with under performing indexes that offer no light of any real social mobility. 

&nbsp;

It takes 5 minutes to open a coinbase account. It took me almost a week to open a brokerage account and the movements in those assets are sluggish (a year of stocks feels like a few days in crypto). Crypto by it's nature is almost purely speculative, has a narrower asset range (1500 tokens vs hundred of thousands of registered mainstream stocks) and is surprisingly easier to understand, evaluate and move positions in and out of than traditional asset classes.

3766,"Now is the perfect time to really evaluate where you are at in cryptos. i don't mean how much your portfolio is down right now in this dip. i'm honestly happy that a correction is happening, this growth the past few weeks has been insane.

i've watched my portfolio drop 50% in a couple of days last summer, and i didn't sell a thing. i've always watched my portfolio rise 200% in the same amount of time.

if one can't handle the swings, this really isn't the investment medium to be considering. dips, corrections, crashes, whatever you want to call them, are the times to be mindful about how much you really have to lose in all of this. did you mortgage your house to buy bitcoin? is the immediate future of yourself, your family, or your dependents contingent on this maniacal market? are you betting rent for next month on the next pump? if your wellbeing, financial or otherwise, depends on this market then you need to RUN away from here.

Find coins with solid foundations, a team you believe in, and technology you think will better, and be adopted by, the world. i'm seeing a ton of FUD from a bit of a dip, and i feel like too many people are invested way above their means following the next hot shill.

tl;dr: tighten your grips, reflect on what you put in, sleep easy

3906,"Morning Update:

Well, everything is up like crazy thanks to the Bitcoin price stabilization at 16.5k-ish.   So many of my sells went through, that I barely have any BTC in Alts right now.  It got to the point yesterday where I started buying a bunch of shitcoins that hadn't moved at all, only to wake up to 35% gains on most of them.  Thats insane.

So, my question is, with all of these gains, when will we see the next BTC run to a new ATH?  The pattern over the last 2 months has been pretty regular.  BTC drives to a new ATH, alts go down, everyone buys them up at bottom, BTC falls and stabilizes, Alts go up 30-50% or more, then the cycle repeats.  It seems to be in week long intervals.  

Does this mean that BTC is heading for the next bull run today / tomorrow? This weekend?  No idea, but what I do know is that it's probably coming soon.  

So, right now, I am hesitant to put any more money in alts.  I feel like its better to hold my BTC, and wait until the next big dip.  However, the FOMO is real, kiddos.  I am so tempted to buy into some of these crazy gainers...

3989,"Hey Everyone, 

Sorry in advance for the lengthly post, I was  just advised by a few of you to go ahead and ask ""Beginner"" questions in here, that hopefully get answered for other beginners with the same questions/interests!

So a small brief background... 
I just started gaining interest in crypto's recently around August (first time I can ever remember even hearing about them). A friend of mine introduced me to them by giving me his explanation of what they were, so I started to do research over the past few months.. and well.. I'm completely fucking lost if I'm being honest.

I understand the basics of course, that its pretty much ""Gold 2.0"", and that they're different than stocks and that one day in the future (Currently with certain coins) you'll be able to purchase things with these coins. 

So before I went ahead and jumped into the market, spending all of my savings (actually what my buddy advised me to do with LTC), I wanted to get as clear of an understanding as I could. 

My confusion is this... You have your smaller coins currently (XRP, Verge and others) for pennies on the dollar, while BTC (around $15,000), ETH ($685) and LTC ($260) are all the top coins in terms of cost right now. Now forgive me again for my confusion and what's probably a FAQ, but why wouldn't I just invest all of my money I plan on investing in crypto's, in the smaller coins to get more quantity for net to nothing at cost than spend a large lump sum in 1 BTC and have that be all I own? Say I have $10,000 to spend on cryptos, wouldn't it make sense to purchase say $5,000 in Ripple, a couple thousand in LTC and then the rest in various other coins instead of putting all $10k in BTC? 

I understand the growth BTC has had in the last couple of years, making individuals millionaires and such but couldn't that be said for anyone who owns any of the other cryptos? (Of course based off of personal opinion on what you think will eventually be worth the most compared to other coins). 

The 2nd thing I don't understand is the online wallets. To me, this seems sketchy and unorganized. For instance, say I purchase 5 LTC today at $260, hold for a couple months or even years and the price ends up what BTC is and I decide to sell. Wouldn't it make more sense to sell in say coinbase, then transfer that money into USD and into my actual bank account? 

I've been trying to understand it as much as I can over the past month or so by listening to various podcasts and reading up as much as I can, but I feel there's so much attention on BTC and cryptos right now I can't wrap my head around what the facts even are or even begin to understand in simple terms what all of this means! 

Again, sorry for the lengthly post, I appreciate any and all feedback. If anyone would like to PM me I'd love to carry a discussion about all of this so I don't clog up this thread! Thanks all!!",0.987,daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017,0.014,0.904,0.081

I've been telling everyone to get in on the NXT airdrop via Bittrex for the last 3 days and Bittrex finally came out and said traders wouldn't even have to remove their coins from the platform to receive the IGNIS airdrop. The futures of IGNIS can be googled, and are trading at $2.20. With NXT trading at $1.10 the value of the airdrop is literally equivalent to the value of the underlying asset (NXT). If you spend $1000 on NXT today, during the airdrop at the end of the week you will receive $1000 in IGNIS.

The math on that: 2 NXT costs $2.20. The value of the IGNIS is $2.20 so literally in 1 week all holders of NXT at current prices receive a 100% bonus, airdrop, profit, whatever you wish to call it. Because of this I expect NXT to continue to appreciate in the 7 days leading up to the airdrop reaching $2.00 by tomorrow evening and $3-$4 by the time of the airdrop. At $4 the value of the airdrop would still be over 25% of the underlying asset. The price of NXT could hit $8 this week because that would place the airdrop at a value of approximately 12%. Get in on NXT as quickly as you can before it moons.

I do own NXT as I believe every word of what I just stated. I am stating my strategy, I am not providing investment advice. I wish you all the best and hope we can all capitalize on NXT appreciating to where it's airdrop is valued at between 12-25%, a climb for NXT of over 400% this week. The more people that realize the ease of not moving coins from Bittrex and the size of the airdrop, the higher the price will climb.",0.9921,daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017,0.0,0.847,0.153

I am concerned I might have gotten hacked. I was attempting to set up some wallets today to move some of my cryptocurrency out of the exchanges that I use. I signed up for MyEtherWallet (https://www.myetherwallet.com/) since it is supposed to be one of the popular ones.

I transferred a few of my coins over to that wallet around noon. Everything seemed to be working fine, until about an hour later. I visited etherscan.io, to check up on the transactions. I searched up my wallet, and it showed that the coins were successfully deposited in the wallet, but then withdrawn into a different wallet. I logged into the MEW wallet, and certainly, it was empty.

As you can see from this link, my coins were successfully deposited into my MEW, but then withdrawn to another wallet (0x0f8a40849ba4dd6895e34be8baa8ddc54d1dcc0b). https://etherscan.io/address/0x101eb3c5354a1eb1f9a18b24e950d77a40b0492f#tokentxns

I even see that there were small amounts of ETH being transferred into my wallet to use as the transaction fee to withdraw my other coins (which I did not deposit myself).

This led me to believe that someone got access to my private key to the wallet. When I was setting up the wallet, I made sure that the site I went to was the legit one, since I’ve heard there have been phishing attempts on these wallets. MEW even warned of these fake websites posing as the real one, so I made sure to bookmark https://www.myetherwallet.com/ I’ve looked through my browser history too to see if there were any strange websites that were just posing as myetherwallet, but I did not see anything suspicious.

There were a few things that I did with my private key when I signed up for the site. I first saved it as a pdf on my computer. Then I printed it out. I also, emailed it to my personal gmail account (using my personal gmail account). Maybe I should not have done this last part. But checking my personal gmail login history, it did not seem like anyone else logged into my account.

My company even scanned my computer for viruses, and the only thing that popped up were cookies.

Two desktop wallets that I downloaded earlier in the day were NEON (https://github.com/CityOfZion/neon-wallet/releases) and IOTA wallet (https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases/tag/v2.5.5). I'm not sure if these had anything to do with my private key getting stolen.

4153,"**Today I'm going to draw attention here to the Particl project; A project I believe will provide added non speculative to *all* cryptocurrencies:**

&nbsp;

*Particl is a secure, privacy centric platform for optionally anonymous, trustless transactions, settlement, escrow, listing and communications.*

It currently exists as a decentralised blockchain represented by the native PART token. The PART token can be either transmitted publicly across the Particl network (as a pseudoanonymous transaction simillar to that carried out by Bitcoin) or it's transmission can be obscured via the use of confidential transactions (CT) to blind observers to the amounts transacted.

Particl also currently has an implementation of ring CT on it's testnet which allows both the participants and amounts of any PART transaction transmitted on the network to be obscured. This implementation of RingCT is currently being audited and undergoing formal peer review by the New Jersey Institute of Technology.

The vision of Particl however extends beyond simple currency. The roadmap aims to transform Particl from a native currency to a full featured dApp platform which integrates native currency (the PART token), marketplace, decentralised exchange, atomic swaps, end-to-end encrypted messaging, communications and 2-party trustless escrow into one modular user friendly client.

There will also be on-chain governance allowing holders of PART tokens to effectively propose, discuss and vote on matters relating to the development and running of the Particl blockchain and dApp ecosystem.

The expected release date for this client is late Q1 2018.

This client will upgradable; because Particl is a privacy centric dApp platform, this means that additional widgets and modules can be built into the client or third party dApps can be built to run on the Particl network. It is expected and hoped that Particl will attract a developer share that is focused on privacy and will contribute to help the platform expand and grow.

&nbsp;

***The ultimate purpose of Particl is to give people the opportunity to communicate, exchange and trade in a secure, private and decentralized environment*** without the need of a bank account and without any body, institution or government interfering or disabling this platform.

&nbsp;

Integration of decentralised exchange and atomic swaps (a process of directly exchanging one cryptocurrency for another without any need for third party) into the Particl client will also allow multiple cryptocurrencies to be sent to the client for automatic conversion to the native PART token for the purpose of transacting on the network. **This in turn will strengthen help strengthen the links of cryptocurrency to fiat whilst simultaneously increasing the ability of cryptocurrency to operate independently of it by enabling the buying and selling of goods and services in cryptocurrency alone.** The Particl marketplace is being designed to act as a focal point for such a process.

4176,"BINANCE CONTESTS: WAVES, TNB, TRX Normally I solely do morning posts but today I noticed a few interesting things on Binance I wanted to share with the message boards. Binance is holding 3 contests, 2 based on trading volume and 1 based on accumulation. All 3 games/promotions will drive significant trading volume of their underlying coins, in turn driving the value of the specific coins higher for the next 3-10 days depending on the specific promotion. I think this is an ingenious way for Binance to get new traders involved while holding free promotions!

WAVES’s promotion is based on how much you buy and accumulate (sales and withdrawals are counted against you). With an airdrop coming at the end of the month and NG activation in 36 hours I expect the next 4 days to see significant upward trending price movement (prediction: 10% per day).

TRX and TNB’s promotion is based on total trading volume with the leaders approaching 1000BTC, but there are still plenty of prizes for smaller traders (sharing 4million TRX or 2million TNB for example). The sheer demand to exchange huge volumes to get more entries creates a game like atmosphere increasing the price for the next 4 days (only 4 days left in the promotion). I expect to see a nice price jump the next 48hrs. Not to mention it is down 40% from today’s highs to still be slightly up overall today (good time to get in).

If you need a referral link feel free to PM me. I think owning either of the three (not to play the game) but as a buy hold strategy for the 3 days while many individuals play the game is a must! If you enjoy day trading it these three are having 15-30% swings daily and you can take part in the game!

NXT is still vastly underpriced with the airdrop coming up and Bittrex supporting it. I expect Poloniex to come out and support it and another minimum of a 30% climb from NXT.

Eg if you bought 1 Ethers' worth of ARK that rose to an all time high of 1.5 ETH. Sell say, 50% of your stack for .75 Eth. Then once it drops again, buy back to your original 1 Ethers worth position, and have .2/.3 left over as ""profits""(depending on how much it actually dropped).

a) send additonal 0.0001 BTCs to my paper wallet

b) import (not sweep) the paper wallet to e.g. Jaxx and send 0.0001 BTC to my paper wallet address itself

     2. send the tx ID from the 0.0001 BTC transfer to UB.com https://www.ub.com/claimubtc

and then: wait for response? Will they email me back?
Anyhow I'd move BTCs to another paper wallet before I import the other private key to the UB.com wallet

I recently started investing in CryptoCurrency. However, I'm a bit unsure regarding when to sell/buy. My coleague at work who got me into this, or some peeps at YouTube, are always telling ""it's low in USD value, now's the time to buy"" or ""It's highest USD value ever, time to sell"". But seeing as on bittrex and binance, we're trading altcoins against Ethereum and BTC, is it not irrelevant or at least incomplete to simply look at USD value? Would it not make more sense to look at it's relative value against BTC and based on that, make a sell/buy?

Or maybe I'm just overthinking things because I'm new to this and not yet 100% knowledgeable, I don't know.",0.7059,daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017,0.033,0.887,0.08

4447,"December 21st Picks: PAY, NXT, WAVE***, MCO, BAY (Yesterday 4/4)
NXT*** should be bought before it appreciates to $3.00 which is an easy target given Bittrex supporting the airdrop and the value of the airdrop being $1.05 per coin while the coins trade at $1.30 per coin.

For Daily Updates Follow on Redditt(articles released early to followers!), IG: JaketheCryptoKing, & Twitter: JBtheCryptoKing
Picks for Today are: PAY, BAY, NXT****, WAVE*, MCO (a surprise one coming for tomorrow!)

Analysis from Yesterday’s Picks: BAT (after the founder’s speech it spiked and we recommended selling) 20%+gain, NXT 40%+ (Bittrex said they will support the airdrop), WAVES 20%+ trending upward significantly leading up to their airdrop the airdrop on the 1st, BCC maintained steady gains all day (sold midday as I don’t believe in BCC for more than their presence on CB). I enjoyed BAT’s quick rise given the founder’s speech. I have nothing positive or negative to say about the technology but when I have 20-30% returns in a 24hr period I smile and walk away. Thank you BAT. I wish you well.

Today’s Picks: I have to reiterate some of the same coins/tokens while focusing on a few new ones. I’ll start with the new ones!

PAY: PAY’s network plans to be fully operational by January 1st, which is the purpose of any coin to have a system to run off of. They hinted at a surprise announcement on December 25th, this surprise announcement could be anything from earlier completion of their payment systems or a partnership, either would be great news! Look for a Christmas surprise and at a bare minimum significant hype leading up to the release of their payment system January 1st and their Christmas announcement.

BAY: I did not choose BAY because it rhymes with PAY but it is always a nice coincidence. BAY has been very secretive of late and what builds value in coins more than anything in the short term? Speculation and anticipation. BAY has promised a Christmas surprise and a NYE surprise. With 2 surprise announcements in the next 10 days there will be significant hype leading up to both December 25th and the Jan 1st announcement. I expect the price to climb exponentially for the next 5 days until Christmas, and after a short dip (depending on the news) a strong rally through the Jan 1st announcement. This is a strong buy and hold for the next 4 days. Then decide what to do with your profits, ride through the announcements or walk.

NXT***: This has been a favorite of mine for the last 2 posts and has yet to disappoint, why I loved it then I still love it now. Bittrex came out and said the NXT airdrop will be supported by their exchange (the price jumped 30%+ yesterday) which means you will not have to transfer NXT off to receive IGNIS coins (the most confusing aspect of an airdrop). Now if you own NXT on Bittrex you will magically have 1 IGNIS for every 2 NXT you have at the time of the snapshot. You do not lose your NXT; you solely get an extra coin. I expect the price to continue to rise leading up to the airdrop by a minimum of 50%. I hope you’ve been following my posts as NXT has made all 3. The airdropped coins future value is trading at $2.10 currently (IGNIS). 1 IGNIS is provided for every 2 NXT held in your Bittrex account at the time of the snapshot next week. With NXT trading in the low $1.00 range your return on the airdrop is the same as your investment in NXT. I expect this to continue to correct itself by NXT increasing in value to the $2.00-$3.00 range by the time of airdrop. Right now 2NXT cost $2.20, but the snapshot provides a coin worth $2.10, a 95% return in a single day? Likely the price of NXT climbs greatly to make up for this issue. I expect to see NXT hovering around $3 by the time of the airdrop.

WAVE***: Airdrop bonus announced on Binance! The more you trade, the more entries you get into their drawing which if my #s are right is worth over $150,000. People competing for these free WAVEs should single handedly increase the value of the WAVE leading up to the airdrop. The real airdrop will occur on January 1st, snapshot occurring on the 31st, but if you are going to buy WAVES you mine as well do it on BInance which is running a promotion to Airdrop 10,000WAVES randomly on the 28th based on those who have purchased from now until the 28th. The competition will increase the value of the WAVE, and the airdrop will also, expect 10% gains daily until the competition is over, and the airdrop is complete! 

MCO: Has increased over 15% day over day the last 48hrs and I believe will continue to increase leading up to 3 significant announcements on the 24th. The company has not yet disappointed with their announcements and MCO has promised 3 the day before Christmas. We know 1 is a new exchange listing, and the other is a partnership, the third is up in the air. However, the publicity provided by the news release and a sleeper pick will lead to increased hype all the way until the 24th. Strong buy and hold until finding out what the news is. 15% gains are expected day over day until the 24th.

THESE ARE SOLELY STRATEGIES I USE IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS BY NO MEANS AM I TRYING TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE. I DO OWN SOME OF THE LISTED CURRENCIES FOR THE REASONS I’VE STATED.

4459,"I've been telling everyone to get in on the NXT airdrop via Bittrex for the last 3 days and Bittrex finally came out and said traders wouldn't even have to remove their coins from the platform to receive the IGNIS airdrop. The futures of IGNIS can be googled, and are trading at $2.20. With NXT trading at $1.10 the value of the airdrop is literally equivalent to the value of the underlying asset (NXT). If you spend $1000 on NXT today, during the airdrop at the end of the week you will receive $1000 in IGNIS.

The math on that: 2 NXT costs $2.20. The value of the IGNIS is $2.20 so literally in 1 week all holders of NXT at current prices receive a 100% bonus, airdrop, profit, whatever you wish to call it. Because of this I expect NXT to continue to appreciate in the 7 days leading up to the airdrop reaching $2.00 by tomorrow evening and $3-$4 by the time of the airdrop. At $4 the value of the airdrop would still be over 25% of the underlying asset. The price of NXT could hit $8 this week because that would place the airdrop at a value of approximately 12%. Get in on NXT as quickly as you can before it moons.

I do own NXT as I believe every word of what I just stated. I am stating my strategy, I am not providing investment advice. I wish you all the best and hope we can all capitalize on NXT appreciating to where it's airdrop is valued at between 12-25%, a climb for NXT of over 400% this week. The more people that realize the ease of not moving coins from Bittrex and the size of the airdrop, the higher the price will climb.",0.9921,daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017,0.0,0.846,0.154

That way you get to keep track of the coins price without seeing the actual total $ amount of your portfolio.  Makes it easier to not care when dips happen, because you dont see your 'money' going down.

So far a lot of people have invested large amounts of money into all the various coins on the premise that the tokens or coins are absolutely necessary to the internal working of the ecosystem of the companies. In this way, because the developers of the companies hold large shares of these tokens, people investing in new altcoins are basically crowd funding these companies in their primary stages. Off the back of mass user participation and engagement in these ecosystems the companies are likely to be eligible for traditional funding from institutions like banks and investment firms to solidify their positions in a very tumultuous developing market and gain advantage on their many rivals. Will it not be the case that those with the actual shares of stock in the company will make the real money if the companies succeed while those who invested in the tokens will be hung out to dry? This is all based on the idea that the tokens/coins being invested in are intrinsically necessary to the functionality of the system, which from my understanding is only the case in a very few instances.

Now that I've been playing with altcoins and my Bitcoin investment has become a bit more than playmoney, I'm starting to hesitate about Bitcoin. 

Right now I need to decide: keep Bitcoin in the assumption that either people really don't understand altcoins and keep pumping Bitcoin for a while, or that Lightning will fix Bitcoins problems. 

OR I acknowledge Bitcoins problems, assume that the general public will do that too before Lightning comes around and fixes its issues. 

I hate to have to think about this, since I've had such a hands off mentality for so long. Right now I think it'll be at least half a year before the general public and the 'dumb' money will become aware of the issues in Bitcoin and figure out that there are good alternatives. I think Bitcoin is still so big it will keep growing for a while, simply because it's the only crypto people know. This might be long enough to get Lightning implemented, which may be not perfect, but it will remove the pressure on Bitcoin and this will cause a further rise.

Multiple wallets?  What are the best wallets to have, desktop or online?  Are their fees to transfer your coins back and forth from these wallets?  Like for instance, if i wanted to invest in XRB, Siacoin, Golem, XRP, XMR, OMG and ARK it seems like i'd need so many wallets.

Also, since Bittrex isnt accepting new users and Coinbase is looking pretty damn shady now, what is the best way of purchasing ETH with fiat and transferring it to one of the lesser exchanges to start trading?

December 20th: NXT, WAVES, BCC, MCO, CB Possibilities for January For Daily Updates Follow on Redditt, IG: JaketheCryptoKing, & Twitter: JBtheCryptoKing Picks for Today: BCC, NXT, WAVES, MCO, RISKY PLAY BAT (either a huge pop or none at all)

I was wrong about yesterday, but I was wrong for unpredictable reasons. There will be wins and losses, Coinbase will add a few coins per year and the day they due, chaos will ensue. The remainder of days we intend to collectively provide an intelligent thought structure that can beat BTC, LTC, ETH and now BCC returns.

Yesterday Recap: LTC trended upwards the entire day, and then BCC was added to Coinbase(“CB”) and the majority of altcoins took significant losses, including LTC. I now recommend BCC as a one week play through the holiday season as the majority of people worldwide have vacation time, and plenty of time to browse CB’s newest addition, BCC. BCC should be a strong buy and hold now that has had its initial spike and tapered off. I presume as more individuals see it available on Coinbase, money will flock to it regardless if they believe in the tech.

Tidbit for Today: BAT has an open Q&A session with their founder and should have a nice bump in price throughout the middle part of the day following the Q&A (1pm EST). Augur also has news coming out today and their price movement yesterday was highly suspicious. At one point Augur was up over 200% before settling back down to an 80% gain for the day. I wonder if the spike was indicative of what today’s announcement is regarding?

Picks for Today: NXT and WAVES have airdrops coming up at the end of December. Both took somewhat of a battering yesterday and the recovered slightly into the evening. The five days leading up to the airdrop will be chaos if it has not already begun by the time of posting this. NXT is providing token holders a 1:2 ratio on the IGNIS token. The futures of the IGNIS token are trading at $2.10 at: https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/ignis/overview/ETH. This means for every 2 NXT you hold on December 28th you will automatically have a return of $2.10. With NXT trading around $0.90 that means you will literally completely cover your purchase of NXT with the value of the airdrop until the value of a NXT is $1.05. If you invest $1000 in NXT right now at $.90 you would have 1111 shares. These shares would provide you with 555 shares of IGNIS at the time of the airdrop. 555 shares of IGNIS at $2.10 apiece is $1165. Simple math shows you the price of NXT will either increase 20% in the next few days to correct for this, or the airdrop is worth more than the actual NXT(which isn’t the case, a correction needs to occur because of the BCC fiasco last night). I expect NXT to rise to a minimum of $1.05 with it likely to hit the $2.00 mark by December 29th.

WAVES is facing almost an identical situation with an upgrade coming to their network this week (should provide a mediocre bump in price) and an airdrop on the 1st (snapshot occurring the 31st). For the same reasons NXT should rally hard into the new year so should Waves.

I believe those who can do simple math will truly appreciate the value of the upcoming airdrops. The best part is the futures are already priced, speculation is decreased when you can presume what the value will be in 1 weeks’ time.

Time to ride the WAVES into NXT year.

A bonus for the Holiday Season! PAY, BAY and MCO all have promised surprise Christmas announcements. You will not be disappointed if the news is good, or if you get out in the hype leading up to the announcements. PAY and BAY promised news circa the 25th, with MCO promising news the 24th (3 releases, new exchange, new partner, and ?). These will all be strong plays to ride the momentum leading up to the news release, and assuming positive news for Christmas, through the news release.

Coinbase has promised to add multiple coins in the 1Q of 2018 (likely January). When CB announces which coins will be added, the price of the specific coins will increase 100% at least. Yesterday BCC was added, and not surprisingly had its significant price jump. The day any coin is added to the CB exchange (if you can call it that), lazy Americans will have exposure to their 5th coin, likely at the lowest price in comparison to LTC, BTC, BCC and ETH. Most have no idea what market cap is etc., so there will inevitably be a surge in price as incompetent investors flock to the newly listed coin (which was only available for years on other exchanges). My predictions for which coins will be added to CB are: NEO, Monero, Augur, Ripple, and Dash. If Ripple is added I believe it will have the most rapid price climb because many won’t understand why it’s priced at $0.80 (even though the market cap has it already competing with ETH and beating LTC). Dash is used regularly in Europe, NEO in Asia, Monero on the dark web, and Augur’s price movement is indicating something suspicious while presenting at very important events in January. Coinbase is likely to pick two or three to not seem like they are choosing favorites and I fully expect Ripple and one or two others to be selected. I wish you well in your strategizing!

Would appreciate your take on my situation. 

I have invested 10.000€ into my portfolio and have 7 different coins. 
Now I’m at 40.000€ and I’m considering to take out my initial investment. 
However I’m still hesitating.
Right now if I take out my initial investment it’s still a huge leverage for the future of my portfolio. 
And I don’t want to get I to the situation in the near future like, If i would have waited longer than
my return would be way higher after taking out

Transferred 0.00574319 BTC (97.47 USD at the time)

Coinbase email says 0.00429179 BTC sent with 0.0014514 BTC paid in fees.
blockcypher says 0.00437368 BTC was transacted with 0.00143856 BTC for fees.

The numbers dont match nor do they add up, which doesnt make sense to me.  

Still, even if I take the lesser of the two sent values (0.00429179 BTC) and calculate what I should have received via the BTC / ETH exchange rate at that time, I get 0.0926 ETC, which is more than the 0.080288 ETH I actually received.

But since I'm noob I need some help. I started by creating a coinbase account, but after seeing the fees and the low number of currencies available, created a kraken account. Got verified (tier 2) and made a bank transfer so i can start in a few days (maybe tomorrow?). Since I'm a student I'm starting with low quantities, so I can get a perspective how things work. My plan is:

Ethereum: 5€

Litecoin: 5€

Monero: 5€

Ripple: 1€/2€

OmiseGo: 1€/2€

IOTA: 1€/2€

The first four are available on kraken, but the last two I coudln't find them. Is there a service, similar to kraken(to reduce fees on transactions until the final coin), (with low fees on deposit) to buy OMG and MIOTA? I've seen some that that I needed to buy bitcoins/ethereum, then send to them so I could exchange for OMG, and in this course there was a fee of 0.3 OMG~ 5€, which completely screws me up on my low investment... What do you think of my ""plan""? What do you think I should know about these or other currencies/services?
Sorry if I did write/understand something wrong


EDIT: I started looking to Bitfinex and it has a lot of coins. But I have some questions. Sending money from Kraken to Bitfinex has the fees associated to each coin. I found [this](http://prntscr.com/hq4y4t) on Kraken, if transfering bitcoin i pay more than 10€ on fees, when in the other ripple is only ~0,10€ is this normal? So I should buy ripple on kraken, send it to bitfinet (paying 0,10€ in fees) and then on bitfinex converting the ripple to anything I want without fees right?",-0.9432,daily_general_discussion_december_20_2017,0.085,0.885,0.029

4. Sells were still disabled?

So at this stage: 

1. Everyone holding BCH (on Coinbase especially) has a solid profit.
2. Everyone who intended to sell BCH wasn't able to, and now has more worth to their coins than they would have sold it at.
3. Everyone who planned to sell, once selling is allowed, will be able to sell for MORE of another cryptocurrency.

Won't this result in an influx of shifting to other currencies, **IF** (big if) people want to move away from BCH?

Aside from the get rich stigma it seems to have, why should I put money into a crypto currency versus some sort of traditional investment? (Which I also don’t know a whole ton about lol).

1. Is it a stupid assumption that a modern System like Blochchain has some kind of safety feature build in to preventie this kind of thing?

2. What happens to the Bitcoin that is in my Bitcoin-cash adress?

Here's what I'm thinking.

Every day, a new cryptocurrency is chosen, and I will lay out the sources for an in-depth discussion about that currency. I'll post up the White Paper, any press releases or technical analyses released on it, it's team and their profiles, and any significant events that have affected it's success.

With all this information, we can discuss all the elements, ask each other questions, and hopefully come out the other end with a deeper understanding of the business that day. Rinse and repeat the next day.

Clearly, I'd be doing most of the work here, but I'm genuinely interested in learning more about the different currencies, so this would be a fun way for me to learn about it all as well.

5211,"I'm very new to crypto investing & have never posted on Reddit before. Here are some thoughts I'd like to share with anyone interested!

It's hard to find a compelling reason to favor one of the major cryptocurrencies over any other if you're looking at it with an extremely short-term perspective. Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin are all performing very well right now for speculators, but it's essentially impossible for anyone to know which one will perform the best for the rest of this year or for Jan 2018, etc...

A lot of the price action in the cryptoverse is correlated. If Bitcoin rallies hard in the short-term, it gives folks increased confidence in Ether & Litecoin and is generally bullish for all crypto. The same is true in the inverse - if Bitcoin plummets hard in the short-term then folks will lose some confidence in Ether & Litecoin as well.

However! All of that being said... if you're looking at this from more of a long-term ""buy and hold"" perspective then it really seems to me like joining the ""Cult of Ethereum"" is a prudent choice right now quite simply because of the potential of the underlying technology.

The Ethereum Network is essentially a beta-stage global supercomputer capable of running all sorts of applications (from Cryptokitties to elaborate financial services). Those applications require ""gas"" (computer resources) to perform their operations & that gas is paid for in Ether.

So, the most obvious logic that I see supporting the bullish case for Ether over the long-term is essentially that as the Ethereum Network grows more capable & powerful (and as more developers produce/launch applications on the Ethereum Network) the demand for Ether will necessarily rise. Bitcoin & Litecoin do not share this quality & those coins will not be used for a purpose similar to this. That's something extremely relevant to consider, imo.

The major long-term downside risks that I see that are specific to Ether include complications regarding scaling the Ethereum Network to be able to handle the very large volume of transactions that will eventually take place within the blockchain every single second & the fact that Ethereum has competitors that could ultimately prove to have built a better product. I'm not very knowledgeable about those competitors other than knowing that none of them have nearly the amount of traction that the Ethereum Network has within the enterprise community (The Ethereum Alliance, etc...)

Anyone... wanna talk about any of this!? :) I love this whole crypto community & want to become a more informed and helpful part of it. Thanks for reading!",0.9967,daily_general_discussion_december_19_2017,0.031,0.802,0.167

Looking at coins like bch, ltc, vtc- Yes, I can certainly see these increasing in price short term with new exchanges being added, dev updates & announcements (especially if bch gets added to coin base). But where do these fit in long term? 

Is it just me, or is the smarter investment to look at coins that have a vision to interoperate within our existing economic and social infrastructure- and are going out and taking steps to build those partnerships. Sure, a coin like VTC has a strong community, it's ASIC-resistant, does atomic swaps etc etc etc, but IMO - the market will move long term on business adoption/partnerships, and real world validation of the projects use.

It has the depth chart based on quantity of ether, not price, and it can be kind of misleading. For example, let's pretend the current price is at $800, and there are orders for 100 ETH both $50 above and below the current price. You would get:

    $750 * 100 = $75,000
    $850 * 100 = $85,000

So, while the depth chart looks perfectly symmetrical, in reality the difference in amount to be sold and bought is 13% ( (85,000 - 75,000) / 75,000). The farther you look above or below the current price, the larger this gap will get. Is there a way to look at a depth chart that is based on the total cost of orders, instead of the amount of orders???

I've recently decided to get into cryptos and I run a small service doing photo restoration and colorization. (I'm a contributor on /r/ColorizedHistory to give you an idea.) I thought it might be good to start accepting payment in various coins and had a couple of questions.

1. For those of you who also offer services for Bitcoin/Altcoins, how do you let your potential customers/clients know without being too forceful about it? I operate a small Facebook page for showcasing my work and don't necessarily want to actively advertise. Maybe I could put something about accepting cryptos on my page's cover photo?

2. Are there any general subreddit communities for sharing that I'm now offering my services for cryptocurrency?

I tried getting an account on Gemini and also was unsuccessful. I am now trying bitstamp (fingers crossed). 

I don't think these currencies will EVER be mainstream unless this becomes easier. Why in the USA should I need to submit proof of residency and a photo ID to just open an account. I could probably go online and have 8-10 new credit cards open in my name in the time I have spent trying to get one account open (and never be asked for a photo of my ID or a proof of residency). 

This all just seems to fly totally against the idea that cryptos are fast and easy to work with. I doubt I am the only one who is struggling with this process.

A simple explanation of crypto currency, based on what I understood, is that crypto currency is like a bill that basically says that person A has n amount of x crypto currency and that ""bill""  is recorded in an append-only encrypted shared log, if that is the case, how did they determine the initial value of it? And how was it initially distributed?

I'm trying to understand crypto currencies and block chain programming, so I started an individual project in making my own -many people have done that, I know- but I need to understand the basic process of it before getting into the programming part.

I've never received any deposits to verify it with and my bank just so happens to not be on their list of banks. So I guess I'm boinked? Coinbase going down is going to cause a huge panic and I could see some very cheap buy-ins on BTC as well as the others. Just my 2 cents obviously new to this but I wish this wasn't such a hassle to get an account going. I just don't understand why the process has to be so complicated? Verifying my bank account for anything else these days seems to take a matter of seconds and there is no back and forth business but I can't even see where things are going wrong for my account to STILL not be verified. Does anyone know of any ways for me to get money onto my GDAX wallet so I can begin investing possibly? Or any other way for me to begin investing into crypto without having to wait any longer? I've missed out on opportunities already that I would have bought into if I had just been verified so this is getting quite annoying.

I'll admit, I just got into crypto lately, since I never bothered to actually understand its underlying benefits and strength. I see them now, that's why I invest. However, I do believe that with the current exposure high risks are involved.
The dotcom bubble, or new market whatever you wanna call it had all the same indicators: you see a new coin being introduced by a startup with some good ideas but often zero prove or liabilities and the next second they sell 200million$ worth of coins in the pre-sale.
It was the same with dotcom. Money was literally thrown at startups, many of which failed, because it takes more than a good idea to succeed. Add some people that are just scamming for money in, and the Desaster was on its way. 
My opinion is that crypto might face the same problem: there's too many and some will!! Not deliver. Obviously, a lot of money will be burned and people that got into BTC or any altcoin for short term profit without understanding the tech, the benefits of crypto or the flaws traditional dollars/Euro will get scared and the bubble will pop. 

Another Point is, that we don't need 10000 different altcoins. Even if they all have unique selling points, in my opinion, a certain number of coins will be the big players, with other coins being used for certain specific activities (like IOTA).

In my opinion, the current growth is dangerous, and the signs are aligned with that. No doubt cryotocoins are the future(so was sitcom), but many people will certainly lose a lot of money in the process.

After the RCN moon, I got out at around 1325 sats.  Probably a little early, but there was too much profit on the table to leave in.  My weak hands got the better of me.

I took my newly acquired sats and put them into the following coins:

1. CLAM - Bought in at 42k sats.  Should moon big this week.  Already up 30%

2. VTC - Bought in at 44k sats.  Nice dip to get in.  This is going back up to the 80k range soon.

3. WAVES - Also was in a nice dip yesterday.  Bought in at 69k sats.  Also hoping this will go up to around 100k since there are events coming soon.

4. SLR - Bought a few thousand at 2750 sats.  There is a dev meeting on Dec 19th.  Should go to at least 5k sats.

5. SLS - Bought in at 165k sats.  Typically gets pumped to mid to high 200k sats.  Will just hold and wait for the next pump.

6. Have a huge buy order on SALT, but I don't think its going to go through.  I think I missed the buss on this one...

Finally took my own advice and left myself about 50% of my BTC to buy into the next big dip.

Feeling discouraged at making bad picks? Think of how much you knew when you first invested in your first coin. I bet you were like me and didn't really have any idea what anyone was talking about on this sub, but you knew ""BitCoin"" was a thing somehow. 

So you bought. You sold when you should have held. You bought when you should have waited a couple more hours. You didn't get rich overnight. 

But look at how much you've learned! Look at the conversations you can participate in, and not just stare at glassy-eyed. On top of being an intense ride, trying to make sense of crypto is an investment crash-course I never would have taken otherwise. 

It's transferable too! I can now better read my traditional investment portfolio. I know a bit more how to read stock charts. I have learned so much! :D

This is a new account because reasons, but I have been on Reddit in this sub and others long enough to know that I am far more educated on this and other topics than I would have been otherwise, and have gotten more value from my losses than any tuition could have paid for.

6180,"Does ICOs need an ICU?

2017 was without a doubt the year of ICOs, for those of you who were late to the party, ICO (initial coin offering) is a crowdfunding event in which Blockchain companies sell newly minted company tokens for ETH or BTC in order to fund their project.

During the beginning of the year, ICOs were starting to gain traction, we saw 2-4 major ICOs a month and project funding raged between 2 to 15 mil USD. In the second half of the year the hype was uncontrollable, there were 2-4 major ICOs happening EVERY WEEK and fundraising hiked to USD 15 - 150 mil, with projects such as Tezos and EOS raising staggering amounts suppressing the USD 250 Mil mark.

Since the golden days of mid 2017, it seems that the ICO craze is cooling down and investors are focusing mostly on larger, more established projects (ETH, Cardano, NEO etc.). There are a few reasons for that:

Too many ICOs, there are around 10 ICOs a day nowadays Increasing competition, more projects are competing for your money and attention
ICO costs, a USD 15 Mil ICO used to cost around USD 200K (team, marketing, traveling etc.) during early 2017, due to cheap liquidity in the space, prices have quadrupled ever since
Scams, there are many of them, including Bloggers tokenizing and selling their future revenue and a chinese mooncake factory ICO, the list goes on… Demand for real products to become reality, people poured money into the hands of Blockchain startups, time to deliver before more funding takes place Investors are different, the industry is flooded with newcomers which hodl BTC or ETH without much affinity to riskier ICO opportunities BTC price hike, no need to diversify in order to make significant profit, just buy BTC

In 2018 we will see Blockchain applications come to life and many investors sowing what they reaped, maybe that will be the second coming of ICOs.

What do you think? Are ICOs becoming a thing of the past?

Here's what is says in the FAQ: 

""Minimum Trade Size:  The minimum trade value for orders is 100,000 Satoshis (.00100000).  There is also a minimum trade quantity.  For example, DOGE trades at 22 satoshis.  The minimum trade quantity is 4500 DOGE and the minimum trade value is 100,000 Satoshis.  The smallest order in the book is 100000 DOGE at 1 satoshi each.  The largest order in the book is 4500 DOGE at 2 btc each.""

So I am looking for a crypto system which contains a 'proportional voting system'. Much like Dashs system whereby token holders decide what the marketing budget will be spent on.

Are there any user friendly ways to create a token like this? I know XLM allows for ICO creation, as well as NEO, Ether and ADA (though that's not released yet).

Having a hard time trying the think of the correct way to word the question, but is there a requirement to report transfers of one type of crypto for another when it comes to taxes?

Like say if you bought into one with usd, price goes up, you then take the value you have in that one and transfer it into a different coin that may have its value falling, but you expect the value to rise again eventually. So you would ""sell"" high in a sense in one, and ""buy"" low into another with the expectation of gaining more value than you had when you initially bought in.

Could you do that regularly and not run into any type of punishment, or maybe restriction, for doing something like that?

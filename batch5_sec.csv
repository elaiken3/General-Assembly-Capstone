89,"Main immediate limitation is the perception--which I personally feel is unfair--that it is difficult to use. Monero has its own code base that is entirely separate from Bitcoin and so can't easily leverage things such as mature wallets from other forks. The underlying differences mean that it can be difficult for some users to immediately get up and running which may discourage people. 

Another potential limitation is that Monero lacks an ICO, dev tax, premine, etc. to fund its development and promotion. While this should be seen as a strength, in the pump and dump world of crypto it can be hard to stand out against competitors who literally have millions of dollars a month to support advertising. 

There are many major innovations coming including the newly-released multisig (key for things such as escrow accounts and potentially helpful to support a Coinbase addition), Bulletproofs (reduced blockchain size and transaction fees), and subaddresses (a tool to help anonymize wallet addresses). All of these should be implemented in the next few months. In the longer term, there are major innovations such as Kovri (an I2P implementation that is akin to Tor) and potentially an implementation of Mimblewimble (a protocol that may enable massive scalability).

Think of it this way - if you’re doing a ton of Christmas shopping and see Snickers bars for sale at one or two of the stores - cool I’m getting a good deal on Snickers bars. 

If EVERY store has Snickers bars for sale, either 1) the manufacturer made too many Snickers bars, or 2) there’s something the fuck wrong with those Snickers bars so they are trying to liquidate them while someone will still buy them.

Since 1 doesn’t really apply to crypto dips, then if it’s dipping on huge volume that means there’s something the fuck wrong with that crypto (or it just got bad news, etc.)

225,"* BTC aka bitcoin is the OG bitcoin we all know and love. It was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto and works as a decentralized way to transfer funds via an added layer on the internet. 

* BCH aka bitcoin cash aka bcash was created by a HUGE Chinese miner (Jihan Wu) because he got upset that his fancy new mining chips (ASICBoost) that were supposed to make him a lot of money weren’t going to work anymore with a blocksize upgrade that BTC was getting (blocksize upgrade is called segwit). 

BCH’s main pitch is that it is currently cheaper and faster to use because, instead of using segwit, they hard coded the blocksize from 1MB to 2MB (also no one is using it).

Some people claim to like bcash more because it’s “closer to Satoshi’s original vision”. Personally, I find this sentiment an incredibly naive one and it spins a very false narrative. Plus I really don’t trust its unsavory beginnings nor the unsavory people supporting it (Roger Ver). These violent delights have violent ends and all that, or however that quote from West World goes. 

* BTG aka bitcoin gold was created by some random Chinese devs and I honestly can’t even remember what their pitch is. Seemed like much more of a cash grab than anything else. They were the fork off BTC that spurred all these other cash grab forks we’re now seeing (Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Ruby, Bitcoin whatever, etc - there are a lot of them). 

BTG isn’t much of a threat to the network. I wouldn’t consider them a safe investment.

Gulden hasn't lost value over time much in $, but as you would have bought the coin in BTC, then you're interested in the coin providing you with more BTc when you sell it.

And I think that Bitcoin's sharp rise correlates strongly with the rises of Ethereum and Litecoin because many new cryptocurrency investors start off on Coinbase, which, as you know, only offers BTC, ETH, and LTC. Back before LTC mooned, it was about $100. I would argue that people would much rather like to have one coin as opposed to a fraction of a coin. I think that's what might have driven Litecoin's rise. The same argument applies to Ethereum. But then again, I don't know much, lol.

As for alt-coins other than LTC and ETH, I'd say alt-coins rise when Bitcoin does. Bitcoin kinda dictates the health of other alt-coins, quite frankly. Specific alt-coins surely pumped for some reason or another. If you mention a specific one, I'm sure that there might be some news article or some happening that caused it to pump.

>3) Increases in price 

It depends on how well ETH performs compared to the alt. If ETH has risen in percentage greater than the alt has risen then you would incur an opportunity cost equal to the amount of ETH you could have earned if you had just stayed in ETH. 

Meaning it’s possible that you cash out of the alt with profits in fiat, but at a loss in ETH. You technically haven’t lost anything expect for the *potential* to make *more* gains in ETH. 

Because you’ll be buying in and cashing out of that alt with ETH it is very important to look at the value of said alt in ETH before making any big moves.

One needs to remember that to truly invest in BTC is to invest in its *long term potential*. 

The tech is still so young and new. There is still so much to be figured out. What we are currently experiencing are some uncomfortable growing pains that are being highlighted during this extremely bullish market. 

There are multiple solutions currently being developed to fix the slow transaction times and high fees. These solutions being developed are for both on and off chain. The problems these people are trying to solve are *hard* and take a lot of time to implement. 

And, considering the truly enormous endeavor that bitcoin has set out on, these people want to be more than careful when it comes to improving on the tech. We can’t have a currency that may one day take over the world suddenly fail because of stupid, rush job mistakes. If the professionals (some of the smartest mathematicians, computer scientists, developers, and cryptographers *in the world*) seem like they’re taking a long time, it’s probably for a good reason. 

In ten years you’ll probably feel *lucky* that you got to be around and experience these growing pains. There is still so much of the world left to jump on board.

One use for this would be to hedge your position by buying Bitcoin and simultaneously betting that it will go down as a form of insurance. If it goes up you lose your bet but have a more valuable asset, so your net gain is less but was risky. If it does go down, your asset has lost value but on the flip side you won your bet, so less lost, less risk. Of course, you don't have to own or trade Bitcoin to make the bets, and just like any other bet, you do need to have someone to bet against you to have a bet at all. Most people aren't looking to bet on Bitcoin right now and given its track record so far, those most would bet it will go up. My guess is that in the end futures will cause a very mild reduction in volatility but not trajectory.

It's never a bad idea to realize gains. But before you make any investment, crypto or otherwise, you need to determine the expected profit and timeline you expect it to happen.


 If you are expecting 200% profit over 3 years as a coin rolls out new features and gets more exposure, don't worry about swing trading trying to get an extra couple coins. You'll be better off dollar cost averaging working a day job. If you're expecting a temporary rush due to news releases or hype, then figure out your target profit and once it reaches that target, sell and lock in your profit.

I used to shill the fuck out of BTC and ETH back in the day, but now I just keep quiet.

I have a friend who is currently talking to anyone he can about his luck in LTC and how much he got. And tbh at a certain point you just get pissed because a) you don't have the same luck/amount of coins and b) you simply don't care about the investment of other people.

So yeah, imho I wouldn't tell other people about it. At least not everytime I talk to them.

I've talked twice about crypto with family members (cousins) and now all they do is ask me in which coin to invest how to do stuff and so on. Without ever actually looking into it themselves. 

I've told them repetedly that I have no real clue either and I am not going to recommend them anything because I don't want them to blame me once their investment goes sour.

1/ BTC itself is consolidating, and if history is any indication, will likely take another run before a psychological breakthrough at $20K. Accounts are still being opened. Big $ is still considering a jump. I just bought 0.01 BTC as a gift to someone for the holidays. And once we cross $20K, it's easy to see a bigger movement to $23-$25 with no issues. I am not going to quote tech charts, because they are useless at the moment. 

2/ CoinBase account holders with 0.1-0.2 BTC suddenly start getting itchy. They want to invest in something with substantial digits behind it. They look at ETH and LTC and decide they want to hold 5 of something vs. 0.1 of something else. 

3/ Right in time for the holidays, when people have nothing to do except eat, drink and impress their Aunt with conversations about how they are now crypto investors.

Then once you're able to withdraw your BTC/ETH, withdraw it to your Binance account and buy something with a little more upside. Learn about some coins, identify some characteristics that you think are important for a coin to grow, and use that template to pick coins to invest in.

What I personally look at for coins/tokens with big upside are the following:

1. Good use case. Always important that the coin actually does something that's useful and could be adopted for some large scale use.

2. Low market cap. Low market cap means that there's a lot of room for growth. Let's use REQ as an example. If REQ were to go up 10x, it would barely crack the top 20 currencies. Don't look at per unit price, as that's irrelevant. 

3. A coin that is not currently sold on CoinBase (and other fiat friendly exchanges), but could be in the near future. This is important because when a coin gets added to CoinBase, many more people get exposed to it which means the price goes up. This isn't *that* important if we're talking long term (5 years+), but in the medium term, this could be huge.

4. Figure out the flaws of a coin. There are many currencies out there, and basically every one of them has major flaws at the moment. Are these game breaking flaws? Are they easily fixable?

There are several other things to take into consideration when picking what coins to invest in, but these are some things I consider. I'm just an idiot on reddit, so take what I say with a grain of salt. There are people much smarter than I who would say to just put your $100 into BTC.

1505,"One of the ideas behind vertcoin is asic resistance. An asic is an application specific something or other. Basically it is a specialised miner. such as these: 

https://shop.bitmain.com/antminer_s9_asic_bitcoin_miner.htm  

These are used to mine litecoin and bitcoin, and possibly other coins which use the same algorithm for mining. These machines are so much more powerful than gpus or cpus that they cannot be competed with. This means that only people with these devices can mine the bitcoin or litecoin blockchain and hope to secure any blocks. What this results in is a form of mining centralisation. The antminer product I have linked above is a company run by Jihan Wu. He is a very controversial figure, both as he controls the production of the majority of these asic miners, and also runs one of the largest mining operations. He also is a supporter of Bitcoin Cash. 
 
Vertcoin, and some other cryptos, like Eth and Monero, have Asic resistant mining standards, and so they can be mined with GPU's or CPU's. This is closer to the decentralised philosophy of the origin (and hopefully future) of cryptocurrency, in which anyone can without the exertion of too much money take part in the network.

Vertcoin may also have other features, but I'm not able to give you more information. There is a vertcoin subreddit on the sidebar you could look into. ",0.7168,daily_general_discussion_december_15_2017,0.013,0.938,0.049

Bitcoin has been through ~7 different bubbles in its 9 years of history. They all played out in essentially the exact same way, but on different orders of magnitude. 

* They each crashed and lead to bear markets 
* Each bear market found its price floor at a price higher than before the bubble began 
* Each brought in new money, growth, adoption, and innovation. 
* Each recovered into a new bull market that always set new ATHs 

This is the cycle of growth that bitcoin has adopted. That is a: bull market -> bubble -> bubble pops -> bear market -> bull market -> etc. cycle. 

So far this bubble looks uncannily similar to all the past bubbles bitcoin has experienced. Considering LN won’t be fully adopted until 2018 sometime (hopefully sooner rather than later) the bubble might very well pop before it 100% adopted on mainnet.

Major issues in crypto right now are

* Mining Cartels

* Slow transaction times

* High transaction fees

Some of these issues also apply to fiat currency (Government controlled), especially slow transaction times. Coins like Ripple or IOTA are attempting to fix these issues, but they aren't the only two. So do your research and listen to what people are talking about. Read white papers and if you believe in the project, invest a little and HODL. Remember don't invest what you're not willing to lose. If you dropped $10 today on something less than a dollar, by the time it becomes worth anything, you'd still have a lot of money. If not, then you essentially just bought a combo at Wendy's that didn't work out.

Looking a little to the future, I suspect it's going to be a race to scale. If Lightning beats Ether's many attempts to scale to the punch, I could see BTC retaining its first-mover and brand-name advantage. If Lightning is delayed and any of Ethereum's scaling projects come to fruition first, I could see Ethereum rising toward or even reaching market dominance. For comparison:

btc Rootstock < eth native smart contracts  (not scaling but in the long run will affect price)

btc Lightning = eth Plasma project

btc other side channel projects <?= Raiden

btc sharding ?? eth sharding (too far out to tell if either is likely to succeed or first)

btc ?? <<< eth Casper staged transition to Proof of Stake (by greatly decreasing computation necessary to validate chain, if successful it will greatly increase main-chain transaction speed and shrink the size of transactions, synergizing with the other scaling solutions. Btc has no comparable project)

btc ?? < eth TrueBit

As to who will grow the most, ETH or BTC, I think it depends on your timescale. In the midterm I think it will depend on who is first to each comparable scaling solution, and in the long run if all of ETH's work out I could see it becoming the market leader.

Ripple checks all (most) of the boxes of an altcoin with tremendous upside potential, Which is essentially what we're investing in at this point and time of Cryptocurrency... YES - There has been A LOT of Negativity / FUD about Ripple not being centralized, especially since their focused on the banking industry... That's fair if you hate banks, but don't let it blind you from Ripple's tremendous investment potential going forward.

Here is a recent statement from XRP's Lead Project Manager for clarity: “By the end of 2018, Ripple will be fully decentralized; more decentralized than Bitcoin…We’ve hired some of the best minds in the business.” “2018… technical side for Ripple is 2018 is really the year for decentralization.”

Definitely more litecoin, it's pretty much guaranteed to keep rising and provides a stable background to a portfolio.

Edit: As the poster below me said, maybe move some of the BTC into some of your other holdings, still keep a decent chunk but if you're holding say ten coins I wouldn't have more then 30% in BTC.

2157,"> I understand it is the first so they have more experience with it but it’s now outperformed by much better technology.

What coins are outperforming bitcoin? Which have better technology?

How do *you personally* know that these coins have better technology? Can you back up these claims with sound technical understanding and sited facts? 

If so I would be most interested in hearing it, genuinely. 

Bitcoin has a long history, yes, but (like it or not) it also has some of the very top cryptographers *in the world* developing, upgrading, and optimizing it. They have been doing so for the past 9 years. Bitcoin itself is very much a work in progress that will continuously be developed and improved upon. At no point has it or will it remain stagnant. 

Have you ever stopped to think that maybe they have a larger understanding then you do when it comes to this sort of thing? Do you think that these top cryptographers in the world would waste their time on bitcoin if it weren’t for a good cause or if they didn’t think it was worth doing so? 

Take Andreas for example. He is a well respected member of the community. He truly believes in what he is saying and he has risked much in order to help push forth bitcoin. 

I’m not talking monetarily, but philosophically. Do you think Andreas and the multitudes of other people like him would invest so much of their energy, time, and emotions into a project that they didn’t think could change the world? 

Do you really believe these people are so unintelligent or naive that they don’t recognize or keep up with other current projects in the space? 

I’m genuinely not trying to be patronizing here. All I’m trying to point out is that maybe before you go talking about how bitcoin’s technology is “inferior” for whatever reason you might want to keep a little perspective in mind and maybe even eat a slice of humble pie.

XRP is making headlines because of banks testing it out, so a lot of hype is causing a spike right now. If you invested a while ago, this is a good time to take out a piece to lock in profit and ride the rest. News in the coming weeks will probably be very good or very bad for the price.

LINK is also getting mentioned in research and tests by banks, so it may also make huge gains if it makes any headlines. I'd recommend holding on to it at least for a day or two to see how it moves.

REQ has Colossus coming out within a week, so good chance it will boom, I would hold for now.

I think IOTA, VEN, and ARK have probably made their biggest recent gains and are settling down now. I think this would be a good time to lock in some profits in those investments.

Monday the 18th CME futures is launching, and BTC is suspiciously stable in price this week with big walls showing up on exchanges to stall breakouts. I think there's a high chance that these are large investors suppressing the price for the CME launch on Monday. Then after the launch I would expect BTC to make large gains.

It will work as seamlessly as a credit card except there is half a chance its a retina scan or bionic implant that holds your private key/ seed. 

Stores, both online and offline will act as sort of consignment shops basically transferring the payment to the creator of the goods immediately upon purchase and transferring the stores cut immediately. Third parties will only be paid for shipping, which coincidentally every good will have a smart contract attached to it, from your bottle of coke up to the palate of sugar etc. Blockchain will track raw goods to the finished product and allow recalls to happen in a much more informed way (recalling 100 affected cars rather than 100,000,000 that you think might be affected). Information systems and shipping lanes will run smoother.

Fractional ownership of everything will exist. For example ridesharing will run through smart contracts and you will be able to partially own a certain time period of ride availability to get you too and from your job. That job will have a series of smart contracts that require deliverables to be completed and payment will be instant. The CEO that now holds the top dog position will be replaced with a smart contract, humans will only advise the company and help to refine smart contracts. The DAO previewed what could be, now we will move to this model in the coming years.

If opted in, all taxation will be taken out during the transaction fees so there will be no need to report taxes to the government, it will be automatic.

Also IOT devices will run eachother via smart contracts and payments in tiny fractions of a coin, this is the IOTA model and this will be the future. Everything from your early bionic implants to your fridge to your home will be in communication via tiny fractional coin smart contracts. 

Also utilities will be paid via crypto per the exact bite of information you use or the Killowatt hour.

The majority of people that are naysayers now will use it without realizing. This is the laggard community. We are just at the beginning of early majority. Everyone getting in now is still an early adopter. 

I know I went overboard here but check back in 10 years if Reddit even exists and I personally bet a bitcoin over half this will be implemented with more on the way.

2369,"I work in finance and I've been following crypto for years. Until a few months ago I would have said ""probably"", but now I'm really not so sure.  Cryptocurrencies have all but lost their original value proposition of anonymous, decentralized peer-to-peer transactions, 99% of the coins out there are blatant scams, and governments are seriously starting to crack down on the space, and/or create their own centralized cryptocurrencies/digital fiat money.  Most people will probably shrug at that point and just use Cryptodollars and move on with life.

What concerns me even more is that about 95% of the people I talk to in person, or see on the internet, have no idea how crypto works and have no interest in using it for actual transactions.  At this point it's become purely speculative, and the current market cap is not really justifiable if you consider the implied displacement of the existing economy.

It’s whole proposed value add on top of bitcoin is its raised blocksize which greatly lowers fees and transaction times. In the short term it is much more usable than btc is if you are wanting to make a lot of transactions. 

However, there are some *serious* risks when it comes to raising the blocksize that threaten decentralization. 

(The bigger the blocksize the harder/more expensive it is for your average user to run a node. Once average users can no longer run nodes then big institutions step in and take it over. 

Big institutions taking over nodes as well as already having unfavorable control over mining = centralization.)

2446,"I'm no expert, but, have been fairly successful with my crypto investments. First thing I did was distribute a good portion of my portfolio in large cap coins like top 5 in market cap. I like ETH, because in my mind smart contracts give it a leg up in terms of utility. Maybe pick 2 or three of these. We're too late to get rich off large cap coins but they are comparatively stable and still provide some nice gains when the pumps come around. Then I selected 2 medium cap, say top 30. Then 2 small cap, below 30. 
When you find coins you are interested in, go to their website, read through their whitepaper. Take into consideration how far along their project is (you can usually get a sense of this from their roadmap), how feasible the project sounds, how marketable the project is, what value the coin offers and how that value is determined, how much competition is in that space. I also like to google some of the heads of the project in hopes of getting an idea of their reputation and ability to follow through. Also, check the forums. The forums will give you an idea of how much feedback the team provides their investors and also give you a sense of the quality of the project. 
Then pull up price performance data for the project. If it is fresh outta ICO, the price usually has an initial spike and then dumps and then becomes fairly stable. Don't buy during that initial spike. For older projects see how current price compares to the all time high, if the current price is at or near an all time high probably best to wait.
After all that is taken into consideration, browse places like reddit, youtube, discord, etc. and see if there seems to be hype for the project. I hate to say it but hype really does seem to play an important roll in terms of at least short term success of a project.
Finally, if a project is still years from having a working product but has a market cap that seems astronomically high, might be prudent to skip over them, at least for the time being. 
Like I said, I'm no expert, just a self taught amateur and welcome any criticism but hope this helps.

Some coins are made purely to be a form of currency (BTC, Monero, Dash and so the list goes on), others are made to be currency but also a programmable platform to run applications and contracts on (Ethereum is the main one). 

A good place to start is reading the subreddits dedicated to each currency, you'll find nice summaries there from people who know far more than I. Remember when watching youtube videos and reading articles online that people are often making these with their own biases and agendas at heart. 

The ambition of these projects are huge and it seems some governments are actively looking to get involved rather than just regulate the space into oblivion. No doubt there are many use cases that will see benefit for governments.

2971,"I’ll speak about bitcoin specifically. Keep in mind there are many different cryptocurrencies which propose different value-adds. You’ll need to do your own research on which you might think are the best or worth something. 

Bitcoin’s value add is its ability to work as a decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash. 

This means that we can send money across the internet trustlessly (without having to rely on third parties or middle men such as banks or other financial institutions). 

If you believe that the ability to transact through a communications medium (like the internet) without a middle man is a valuable ability, then the network which makes this possible (like bitcoin) will capture a certain amount of value - proportional to how valuable that ability actually is for society. 

Proportional to how valuable society deems that power to be. 

Finally, the bitcoin network divides this total value (currently $287 billion) up into a finite number of units: 21 million. So these coins, or tokens, basically represent shares in that total value captured (currently $17,200). 

I’ll add that the internet itself is a network that is made up of different layers. The layer we are interacting with at this very moment is one comprised of pretty web pages and a pleasant user experience. It didn’t always used to be like this, if you are old enough to remember. 

Bitcoin itself is adding another layer on top of the internet. It is a new technology that is still being developed and the world is still speculating on how much worth it could potentially be. These are very early days and right now the safest way to invest in the tech is to buy and hold it for 5-10 years and see where it takes us. We’re waiting to see just how much it might change the world. 

I would suggest checking out the [official bitcoin website](https://bitcoin.org) for starters and watching Andreas Antonopoulos talks on YouTube to learn more about bitcoin. 

As you become interested in more coins you can move on to reading about their technologies. ",0.9944,daily_general_discussion_december_13_2017,0.0,0.835,0.165

2973,"Here's some dead easy answers:

1.) What is the use of crypto?

Its basically using money or tech without a third party. Right now if you want to send someone money across the world, you have to go through intermediaries. Go to the bank, who speaks to your recipients bank, etc. There's fees involved too. With Crypto You send it from your wallet, to your recipient's wallet, with minimal fees and almost instantaneously. This is the first gen of Crypto. 

The second generation of crypto are platforms, utilises something called 'Smart contracts'. Basically  its the same as the above but there's now you can set up conditions. For instance, You can set ""i will send Bryan 1 ETH if the weather tomorrow is Sunny"". If the weather isnt sunny tomorrow, that contract never executes. That's it at its most basic level, but now a lot of businesses are taking advantage of this conditions feature by building businesses out of it. things like Golem (Decentralised processing) Sia (Decentralised Storage) Walton (RFID+Blockchain) and a bunch of others to name a few.

2.) The government is gonna regulate this stuff

This makes me laugh.. This is like saying you can regulate air. How are you regulating something that is immutable, transparent and doesnt go through any regulatory bodies? Laughable.

i guess coinmarketcap.com uses an average of the prices from all exchanges combined.. thou iam not sure about that..

Otherwise, you're losing twice as much money on the exchange / network fees to reach roughly the same position. 

Don't pay yourself dividends just because other people think it's a good idea. You need to determine for yourself if it makes sense for you and your current situation. Have you invested more than you can afford (missing bills, over credit limits, etc.)? Do you have something you would like to start saving for (car, wedding, etc.) that the extra money would help with? Are there any benefits to holding for a little while longer (taxes, expected news / announcements)? These are the type of questions you should be asking yourself... or finding a professional financial planner to assist you with answering.

Fixed weight rebalancing tends to be the best strategy in most non-crypto financial markets over the long term as they tend to revert to their long-run values/trends over time and some have capped upside. 

Arguably cryptocurrencies have the opposite characteristics. Sentiment and animal spirits play a a significant role in the recent price movements so cryptos tend to exhibit a momentum effect (e.g. rising prices has encouraged more investors to buy). 

In these sorts of markets, particularly if you believe the broad thesis that we are due to see further inflows as crypto becomes more mainstream, it might pay to hold on for a little longer than usual before selling. Maybe recycling 20-50% of any gains rather than 100% for example. 

Rebalancing will make money in choppy markets where there is no real trend. Momentum will win where there are significant bouts of up or down trends.

[Here's a comment I made yesterday about getting started with learning how the tech behind the big 3 work](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7j0cw9/daily_general_discussion_december_11_2017/dr46f95/).

As for advice on entry, to be completely honest for at least the next 6 months to year none of the ""big 3"" (BTC, ETH, LTC) are a bad investment. 

However, if you had to buy one **right** now I'd venture to say ETH is the best bet. It's been seeing some steady growth over the past few weeks, and looks to be attempting another bull run.

BTC has seen **huge** gains over the past few weeks, and a lot of the sentiment is that people are wondering when it's going to crash. However, this could never come, as historically betting against BTC rarely has worked out.

LTC also has just gone on a huge bull run in the past few days and is due for a correction. After the correction though it wouldn't be a bad buy. I won't comment on LTC's longer term outlook as it's just speculation and personal opinion.

For other alts, I can't comment on IOTA as I'm not too familiar with it but [this guide](https://matthewwinstonjohnson.gitbooks.io/iota-guide-and-faq/) looks to be a good place to start (grabbed from the /r/IOTA sidebar).

XMR can conceptually be compared to Bitcoin, with one big exception Monero is truly anonymous (like actual cash) while Bitcoin and other coins with a public blockchain are only pseudo-anonymous (there are more differences between than just that, however that's the biggest one). The [getting started](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/5zgail/rmonero_newcomers_please_read_everything_you_need/) post on /r/Monero is a good resource for learning more about it. Monero isn't the only crypto though with privacy in mind, so if that's your thing you can also look into other coins with a focus on privacy (DASH and Zcash being two I can name off the top of my head).",0.9398,daily_general_discussion_december_12_2017,0.02,0.908,0.072

But you should look at the recent popular coins and do some research base on the purpose and functionality of the coin and different factors. After that decide on your own whether you'll put money in it. You can see recent popular coins by reading this daily subreddit. Which popular coins are mentioned a lot of times such as IOTA, Litecoin, REQ,XRB etc.

1.Never blindly follow someone's advice on Reddit while you're investing. ( Even this post haha, judge what's right or wrong)

2. Diversify your portfolio with multiple altcoins instead of putting all eggs in the same basket and spending all your money on a single coin.

3. Take a look at the subreddit for more info. Most people buy Bitcoin and ethereum on coin base, while you can use Binance to trade for alts

- For Protecting coins, I ordered Ledger Nano S *bold* from the website of the company *bold

4089,"You've got a few bits of math to learn. We'll assume your fiat currency is dollars.
  


You want to put in $100 into Req, say. 
You can buy 100 dollars-worth of BTC, ETH or LTC, send them over to an exchange, and buy $100 minus fees of Req. Lets say that one month later it is worth $125. You've made $25 profit. so you you could sell the Req into dollars, and you'd have $125 minus fees.

There is a second step, sort of an intermediary stage really. 
you buy $100 of ETH, which currently is like 0.175 of ETH. 
You buy Req with this.
it is $100 dollars worth. lets say you get 50 Req.
When, in a month, you sell the Req as it's worth $125, it could be worth 0.22 ETH, as the price of ETh has gone down relative to Req over that month.
If this is the case, you have done better than just holding the ETH. It could be worth 0.13 ETH, in which case, you'd have done better just holding onto ETH, or buying something else. If you're interested in $ profit, it is broadly irrelevant.  
 

if you're talking about high and low in terms of the percentage change over the last 24 hours, it would seem to indicate that yes, buying things in the red will be a better investment than buying things in the green, because surely they'll go back up. This isn't the case, as the percentage change over 24 hours is not a good market indicator, and says nothing about where a coin should be. It's often referred to as trying to catch a falling knife. It is especially tricky in crypto, because the alt coins are denominated in BTC or ETH usually, rather than a stable currency like the dollar.  
if you look at ETH on this chart: 
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/#charts 
You will see that buying ETH with bitcoin has since June been a bad idea, and your return would be better had you just held your bitcoin, however you will also notice that you'll still be several hundred dollars up.

The coins that you see at the very top have paved the road for this market and brought it to where it is, thank you. However, much like myspace or napster they do not remain the king. Hundreds of projects are in development and most of them will not succeed but I'm a firm believer that the Facebooks, Apple or Google of cryptos has yet to appear.
With Ethereum alone you have several great projects that are aiming for Ethereums role as the dApp platform (Qtum, NEO, Lisk, Komodo, Cardano, Stratis, NEM, XEM etc...). A lot of competition in the space and just because the likes of ETH and BTC getting a head start does not mean they will reign supreme forever.
That said, they are good buys currently. I highly advise that you research who the competitors are for the top coins and see what their project is doing and could be potentially be doing better.",0.9819,daily_general_discussion_december_12_2017,0.021,0.813,0.166

4137,"There's two ways you can look at it. One, it is indeed a very smart move which means that no matter what happens, you'll never make a loss from your initial investment. The way that I look at it however is that while December hasn't really been a good month, I feel like we're generally still in a bullish period and will be even more so in 2018 especially for altcoins. Unless you're getting greedy and/or careless and/or emotional, it's not hard to make money in a bullish market especially if you do your due diligence and research which means that more money in = more profits.

That being said, I am a trader and have slowly withdrawn more than my initial investment to date because I rely on my profits to feed myself and pay for certain bills which could be the reason why I'm feeling pretty comfortable about things although given the choice, I would not have withdrawn a single cent which would have translated into a lot more money in my portfolio. Also, I constantly reevaluate my position and strategy in case my assumptions (bullish period, 2018 good for alts, etc.) are wrong.

tl;dr - It depends on your risk tolerance but if you've followed the advice 'never invest more than you're prepared to lose', then it should be fine either way.",0.8443,daily_general_discussion_december_11_2017,0.059,0.823,0.117

However, if you're brand new crypto and don't really understand the core concepts of the technology and how Bitcoin and other cryptos work (i.e. blockchain, decentralization, mining, etc.), I would suggest watching [3Blue1Brown's video explaining how Bitcoin (or the general idea behind how it works) first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4). Going in with a general idea of how it works before reading the whitepaper will probably be beneficial and make the whitepaper easier to read/understand.

After that, if the Bitcoin whitepaper wasn't totally foreign to you, and you want to read more I'd suggest the Ethereum whitepaper. As Bitcoin and Litecoin are mostly the same tech with Litecoin offering a few relatively small changes ([an overview of the differences can be read about here](https://www.coindesk.com/information/comparing-litecoin-bitcoin/)), if you have an understanding of Bitcoin you'll have a good idea of how Litecoin operates. Ethereum on the other hand is actually quite different from the two, while still operating on blockchain tech, it's goals, use cases, and implementation are different.

4202,"Yes, usual market on alt exchanges are altcoin ->  BTC/ETH/USDT. 
USDT stands for tether so don't let that fool you. I avoid it.
So usually you start by buying BTC or ETH and then converting one of the two into alts. Coinbase is the most popular choice but I suggest you bitstamp since they have lower fees (0.25% compared to 1.5%)

Then you transfer BTC to alt exchanges (bitfinex,bittrex,binance, etc) and start trading. I prefer binance (lower fees, interesting coins)

4331,"It's all considered taxable as capital gains any time you *sell* a currency, be it for USD, or for any other currency. The only reason I make this distinction is because you can buy any currency with USD and there is no taxable transaction taking place. If you sell BTC for ARK, or LTC for ETH, or anything else, it's taxable. Buying any of them with USD? Not.

Anywho, that distinction aside the IRS has judged it to be an asset rather than a currency, and so treats any instance of you selling it as a taxable event (capital gains tax), but this can go both ways. If you buy Bitcoin for $2,000 and then sell it at a loss for $1,900, that's not taxable. In fact, if there are other capital gains taxes that you're already having to pay beforehand, it's tax *deductible*. This also works with BTC-ratio transactions. If you bought $1,000 worth of NEO with $1,000 worth of Bitcoin, then later on sell that NEO again into Bitcoin, but the NEO has devaluated so that it's only $900 worth of BTC that you're getting back, you can still mark that $100 loss as a deduction on capital gains taxes.

Ideally, you won't be losing anything anyway, but those are just the two main points I wanted to explain [shittily, so apologies there] aside from just saying it's taxed as capital gains.

Oh, and while reporting taxes is obviously the ideal thing to do, I just want to correct you on Coinbase's reporting to the IRS; they agreed to report the information of anyone who made any single transaction worth $30,000 or more during the 2013-15(16?

4348,"Each candle represents a certain amount of time (this is adjustable- in your own photo they seem to be scaled to 1 minute intervals). 

There are two main components of each candle; its body and its wick. The main body is the actual rectangle itself that makes up the majority of each candle. When a new time interval begins (say, 8:59 turns over to 9:00 and the new candle for 9:00:00-9:00:59 appears) the first transaction that takes place in that time interval sets in stone the beginning end of the candle. For this example, say the first transaction was at $100 exactly.

Now, if the next transaction is a sell order, which lowers the price to $99, the other end of the bar forms (it was already there technically, but both ends were at $100 at the same time, since there was only one transaction to work with and it represented both the first and most recent transaction) at the $99 mark, and now there is a *red* bar between $100 and $99 dollars, signifying that price has gone *down* from the initial price at the beginning of the period (9:00:00-9:00:59).

Now, say the price bounces back between $99 and $100 for the next fifty seconds, but suddenly someone sells a sizeable amount and the price goes down to $98, but quickly bounces back to $99 just in time for the candle's period to end, and the next period (9:01:00-9:01:59) to begin. The main body of the rectangle would have briefly gone down to $98, making the bar $2 'tall.' Since the price went back to $99 though, the bar shrunk back to the $1 height between $99 and $100. If there were no other component to the candle, there would be no way to tell that the price had dropped so 'low' compared to the rest of the period. This is where the wick comes in.

The lines you see stemming from the top-center and/or bottom-center of the candles represent these outlying prices. Since the price briefly dropped to $98, there would be a single line protruding from the bottom of the rectangle, whose lowest point was at $99, to reach $98 and signify that the price was, at least at one point, as low as $98. This can go both ways, with a candle on each end.

Keep in mind that a Green candle doesn't necessarily mean that the entire period was mostly buy orders, or that a red candle was mostly sells- if a ton of people bought at $100 but there was a massive wall at that mark preventing the price from rising further, and the price only barely dropped down to $98 and then back to $99 right at the end of the candle, it would show just the same as if the price had immediately dropped from $100 to $98 and sat there for 59 seconds before quickly moving back to $99 right at the end.

4377,"Here's a very small list of things I put together for you. There is so much more, though. Walton is hugely disruptive. It's more than just ""clothing."" People have this skewed idea in their heads. In reality, Walton is a platform that can disrupt many industries with their patented ultra-high frequency RFID chips, capable of scanning multiple chips at once from a distance with the highest fidelity. They are the most advanced, smallest (nearly microscopic), and cheapest RFIDs ever made. They are tamperproof, and if removed will be destroyed. They are also encrypted and unhackable. Combined with blockchain, this allows for true authentication, and can take down the counterfeit industry. Walton accomplishes this better than VeChain or Wabi, for instance, because the chips are UHF-RFID versus NFC and RFID which is what wabi and vechain use. Their chips have to be scanned up close, and cannot handle the amount that walton can simultaneously. Also, their chips are larger and non-discreet, in the form of large tags and stickers. This reduces the number and type of items that can be tagged for counterfeit. Walton can tag *everything*.  Walton is also infinitely scalable due to the Parent/Child chain organization. Wabi can actually be ran as a simple child chain on WaltonChain. There is so much more, so read more into it, but here's a quick list of partners and people involved. There's more than this as well, but these are things that might interest you at first:

*5. How much testing has been done in real companies who have opted for integration of WTC to see if it will be long term beneficial?*

R： Up to now, many companies such as Tries, Joeone, SMEN in the apparel industry, Kehua, Lipson plastic in the manufacturing industry and Xiangyu group in the warehouse industry have applied for our WTC & RFID integration system. What is impressive is that all of them have benefited a lot by integrating our system! Compared to before integration, their yield rate has increased by 1.2%, the stock turnover increased by 5.8%, the distribution efficiency has improved by almost 100%, and the inventory efficiency almost tripled in their stores.

4441,"I had a hard time parsing out the BTC ratios when I first started, and for a good while afterwards too. You just get used to it, really. It's partially about familiarizing yourself with the BTC ratio and how everything is compared to BTC, as well as being a factor of familiarizing yourself with the other currencies you're trading in. 

For example, NEO and LSK are 0.00204 and .000481 right now, respectively. Now, that probably doesn't mean much to you, which is fair. I can't even translate that to USD in my head and generally never bother to, unless I want to see how much my investments are worth at the moment (and even then I just look at Blockfolio, most times).

Instead of worrying about USD, I've familiarized myself with what ratio the altcoins have- NEO being at 0.00204 *does* mean something to me because I know it was at 0.0022~ or so yesterday. A quick glance at BTC says the price is going up, so it would have been more profitable overnight to be in BTC than NEO, were you trading. Or, if you're like me, it's more important because you're *in* BTC and waiting to buy back into NEO at a cheaper rate. It might have to be below 0.0215 for me to break even, and my target might be 0.0195 or something like that. If it starts shifting back towards 0.021 then I might go ahead and buy back in, so that I don't go over my break-even rate. Hopefully that example made sense?

Heres some general buying strategies
* Use limit orders. It reduces your fees that you have to pay. On binance you have the option to use bnb to pay so you have less fees.
*Always set a stop loss and profit taking price. Buy on red days and sell on green days. Profits on paper will always remain on paper until you cash in. 
*Read the white paper of the coin if possible so you know what your trading in or investing in. Some coins may be pump and dump coins and you don't want to get burned by them.
*Look at the coin supply and market cap of the coin. This will help you gauge how much your investments may potentially grow. I'm no expert in this but the general logic is something that has low supply and low market cap may grow more compared to something with over a few billion coins and a few billion marketcap.
*Join subreddit communities, telegram groups and discord chats. So many things happen at once that its hard to keep track of news. Don't limit yourself to reddit as your only source of news. Like I said read, a lot.",0.023,daily_general_discussion_december_11_2017,0.083,0.842,0.075

4551,"1. Are you searching for cold storage?

2. Find a project that you really believe it will rise in long term. Check out market cap, circulating and total supply, project team, roadmap, current state of the development and worth of the market they are trying to cover. It will make you feel confident when holding. You can check on coin market cap under markets where you can buy it.  Binance is one of the bigger exchanges for alts and has most of the good coins and they keep adding it.

You can use this referral link if you like
https://www.binance.com/?ref=10196951


However, on binance you can not exchange fiat directly to other crypto currencies. You would first need to buy BTC and then transfer it on binance.
Coinbase is the most popular choice for buying BTC but if would suggest you bitstamp  (lower fees 0.25% compared to 1.5%)

For QTUM and PIVX, they tell you that the device must be left on 24-7, although with NAV, you can simply open the wallet on your computer and the time you have it open counts towards staking.

I think the best bet for far future success is going to be getting into this ledger and then hope that a future hard-fork keeps it evolving. If you buy into btc now you get counted into every future hard fork between now and 10 years from now.,0.8858,daily_general_discussion_december_11_2017,0.042,0.833,0.124
4665,"BTC is the absolute safest bet in terms of crypto investing. It has the strongest dev team. It has been tested the most thoroughly. It has the longest history of success. You don’t need to buy whole coins to still have something that counts. 

I prefer coins that have a longer history of success. ETH has potential and Monero is probably also a decent bet. 

LTC is just a worse version of BTC and throughout its history its price has never made any substantial moves one way or the other without bitcoin’s influence. The only thing it has going for it in the future is being lightning network compatible which might boost its success once that takes over.

If you're just dropping a few bucks to see what happens in the long term, it can't hurt. It's kind of like buying a lottery ticket hoping you've bought bitcoin around 2010/11. Which is somewhere between long term investing and gambling.

A lot of folks in the market are kidding themselves what we're doing is investing. It isn't. This whole thing is  a near  perfect example of the 'greater fool theory'. We all hope that more people out there keep buying in. Eventually we will run out of people, but given this thing is global that could take a wee while yet. I also think the English-speaking world is in an echo chamber and not switched on to what North East Asia is thinking, it's impossible to read the global mood. I've noticed that often when North America goes to bed and Asia wakes up (or vice versa) there can be noticeable changes in momentum. It basically means that both ends of the world hope that the numbnuts on the other side keep buying.

4768,"Decred is my #1 long-term alt. It's Bitcoin with on-chain governance.

A few years ago, a couple really smart people (the developers of btcsuite & zkc) looked at all of the fundamental problems Bitcoin had, and decided to make an altcoin that attempted to solve them: https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/11/bitcoins-biggest-challenges/

They reckoned that governance was the fundamental problem that Bitcoin suffered from - and everything else stemmed from that. Take transaction times & fees for example, there is plenty of decent tech out there that's superior Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is unable to adapt and change over time. With Decred, users vote on proposed changes to the blockchain rules. A few other projects have vote signalling, but Decred is the only project with binding on-chain voting.

Decred is also neat because it uses a hybrid PoW/PoS system that makes it resistant or immune to most crypto attack vectors. For example a 51% hashpower attack would be extremely hard since the blocks have to be approved by the users. A minority fork would also be extremely difficult without mutilating the code, making a Bitcoin Gold type situation improbable.

4769,"It's solving a fundamental problem that no other cryptocurrency is currently tackling: that of governance, via voting: a more elegant solution than the endless forks we see in Bitcoin... Cash, Gold, Platinum, and God knows what's next, Stainless Steel? - 

Other than diluting the brand and confusing newcomers, there something more important to say here: what gives values to Bitcoin? its censorship-resistance, achieved via decentralization (see use cases: WikiLeaks, Venenzuela protection against inflation, etc.) - 

So the projects that could increase decentralization would add value: and DCR does that by further decentralizing cryptocurrency since it decentralizes the political moment (governance), as every* stakeholder (coin holder) can cast a vote on the future of the project, participate in the decision-making project and get rewarded.

It's also a kind of decentralized organization on the blockchain, it is self funded and a Proposal System is coming soon that will function as a crowdsourcing/kickstarter for development (again, via voting). 

I believe the Technical Analysis shows a reversal of downtrend for BTC/DCR, so we could see a major long-term uptrend from end Dec to January.

4774,"If you're interested in something with greater potential for return, check out Spectrecoin (r/XSPEC). 

The tech is similar in many ways to Monero but something that separates Spectre is that it's proof of stake so you get a 5% yearly interest. It will also primarily function through the TOR network with obsf4 to allow usage in TOR blocked countries like China. 

Right now the market cap is hovering at 6-7 million. The development team is working ultra hard to roll out the next updates. Mobile wallet staking will come in 2018. Monero is at a 3.5 billion market cap. It is great tech. But know that privacy coins as a whole are  all likely to grow in need as governments futilely restrict control capital flow through the more public cryptos like bitcoin. 

It's no Monero, but there's no reason why Spectrecoin coin can't hit a market cap of say 100 million like a Verge or 250 million like a PIVX. Just look at this chart and compare the tech. If Spectre does manage to blow up that's some absurd returns.

4912,"So Bitcoin uses a blockchain, which is a decentralized ledger. Imagine a big piece of paper that says how much money everyone has, and we can all watch changes being made to it to make sure it's legit.

You can think of a fork as being like if someone scanned a copy of that piece of paper... now there are two... A and B. They start with the same record, but now changes can be made to one but not the other. Let's say Johnny owned 500 units on the original paper. Both paper A and B still say he owns 500 units. But now the record keeping and changes are done separately.  So Johnny can give 500 units to Billy from the units on paper B, but not modify the values on paper A.

So with Bitcoin, everyone who had Bitcoin at a certain point in time for example also got the same amount of Bitcoin Cash. One set of records split into two separate records. So you could sell your Bitcoin Cash without selling your Bitcoin.

A lot of people like forks because they think of them as dividends or free money. However, I think they are harmful to the ecosystem because they distract from more important things. They also devalue the brand of Bitcoin, which is valuable in part because of it's scarcity (there will only ever be 21 million btc). Imagine in 10 years if there are 50 different Bitcoins, how confusing would that be?

**TLDR; It's when a currency splits into two currencies, w/ everyone from before the split getting an equal amount on both chains.**

edit: The term hard fork is also sometimes used to refer to what you would think of as an ""upgrade"" to a blockchain. It's effectively the scenario as described above, except they don't use paper A and just wanted paper B because they wanted to use a pencil instead of a pen or some change like that.",0.9681,daily_general_discussion_december_10_2017,0.029,0.881,0.091

Generally, these have a tendency to be money grabs, and I advise doubling up on research (esp the devs and their progress) before investing. That being said, as a disclaimer, I do not classify bcash as a money grab and actually agree with bigger blocks as a short term solution.

Kraken is getting a bit old, so I'd recommend sending fiat to kraken (which will take a few days), buying bitcoin or Ethereum, and, if you want to buy any other cryptos, sending the bitcoin/Eth to a different exchange with a better trading engine and selection of cryptos. If you don't want to buy any others, then look into setting up a secure wallet for the cryptos you have. 
 
Once you have the fiat traded for Eth/BTC, you can use a wider range of exchanges not bound by fiat currency requirements.

As for the sake of ETH, right now holding a token is speculative (correct me if Im wrong), although they are moving to POS from POW slowly. Staking your coins would then produce a reward from the blockchain is how I understand it. As for NEO, staking your coins in your wallet produces dividends paid in gas everytime a block is created. This gas can be sold on an exchange.

A smart contract is basically an agreement between entities written on the blockchain which is immutable and verifiable. Basically it is a binding contract which cuts out the middleman for such things as escrow and large money transfers and such. Or any contract for that matter. What makes the first genesis cryptokittie worth so much? The fact that we can go back and look and see that it was the very first. Someone could make a clone similar, but the blockchain would refute the fact it is the original.

As for worth investing? These platforms are where all future projects will be built upon. Thus increasing demand for its token. ",0.8753,daily_general_discussion_december_10_2017,0.03,0.875,0.095

Some of them are:

I think Coinbase could be a start for buying for US citizens... Also, look for Bitcoin ATM in your area. That ones could be the easiest way to enter. 

What you need to watch are the fees. When i buy at a regular atm (not Bitcoin atm, it is a payment ATM with lot of other stuff, you should have there things like that i suppose) i buy ETH and then transform it in BTC or other altcoin. It has a very low fee comparing to Bitcoin.

So you should check the prices too from where you buy. I'm not in the US so don't know if you have other ATMs except BTC ones.

Transaction fees vary. I know Bittrex has 0.25% per transaction. Binance has 0.05/0.1% so trying to trade on small % changes isn't worth it.

Transactions are instant if someone is willing to buy at the price you are selling. If you want a certain price for a coin you will have to wait for someone to be willing to buy it at that price.

Yes with very low volume coins you can make a difference to the price. It's also a lot harder to buy at the price you want for low volume coins as there aren't many sellers. If there was only $500 volume in the last 24h then if you wanted to buy $5000 worth then you would have to buy at a premium and increase the price of the coin as not enough people would be selling. If you see a 100% increase on a coin with only a few thousand 24h volume then it's likely 1 person pumping it. 

Trades are mainly BTC to alts. Some exchanges also do ETH to alts.

If you're asking if we're in a bubble, I suggest doing your own research into the fundamental technologies, differences between cryptocurrencies and a bit of technical analysis.

edit: I misunderstood your question. In the case of a recession, it is difficult to predict how crypto as a whole will be affected. Bitcoin was born out of the 2008 recession when faith in traditional banking institutions was very low. If people equate crypto like they do gold, perhaps money will flow into crypto.

I'd think proof of stake would speed things up as well, but maybe it is faulty to think mining takes more time than staking would potentially take. Cardano is researching some interesting blockchain tech as well. 

Another approach is the Iota model of confirming transactions to create transactions. It is a very clever solution, but I feel the implementations of the idea are shaky right now. Raiblocks is a similar coin.

You could look at the current problems faced by Bitcoin, high fees and slow transactions, and conclude that Bitcoin has a tech problem. However, there are plenty of other projects without the high fees or slow transactions. How come Bitcoin doesn't simply adopt their tech?

The answer is that Bitcoin doesn't have a technology problem, it has a governance problem. The tech it needs to solve it's current problems is trivial, yet the shareholders cannot come together and change it.

High fees and slow transactions are the problem today, but it will be something else in the future. Only a project that can successfully adapt over time can be considered future-proof.

Check out market cap, project team, roadmap, current state of the development and worth of the market they are trying to cover. It will make you feel confident when holding. Don't buy at all time high if the price was rising too suddenly . I usually search for the dip for the coins that I believe in long term. Rule of thumb: all cryptos are pretty much influenced by BTC. When BTC rises suddenly most of them fall. When BTC falls down suddenly most of the cryptos fall. When BTC is stagnant or has a slow steady rise, alt coin flourish.
Also one more advice that I can give you. Remember to take part of your profits when it's skyrocketing. This is still haunting me with me and my NEO :)

5544,"5 years is an extremely long time in crypto-space. If you are looking for that kind of investment - where you put money in and don't think about it while it grows - you're better off in mutual and hedge funds. 

That isn't to say that you shouldn't have long term goals while going into cryptocurrency (actually far from it) but you should realize how volatile the markets are. Bitcoin jumped 8k in 7 days. The most speculation anyone is doing for the oldest cryptocurrency (and therefore has the most data) is end of Q1 18. If you are serious about investing it is an active investment you need to maintain to make sure you follow the trends but don't fall into the ponzi schemes. 

Disclaimer aside, the only ones I have backed are ETH ARK and IOTA simply because they are the only ones I've fully researched (and even then I'm on the fence for IOTA). I'd be quite arrogant to say they would be the top performers 5+ years from now. ",0.5589,daily_general_discussion_december_8_2017,0.035,0.899,0.066

5547,"To be frank, that long of a time-span isn't really feasible in this market. Long-term here rarely means longer than a year, if that. For traders, the term can shrink even further (and I mean substantially, like in terms of a few months).

I'm not saying that keeping your funds investing *in* crypto is a bad idea, in fact it's a brilliant idea and you stand to benefit greatly, but you can't just put the money in and just let it sit for 5 years. Things change rapidly in the cryptosphere, and a coin that's doing spectacularly well right now, even if it seems to have a bright future ahead of it, could end up being outclassed by another up-and-comer and then fading into obscurity. ETH and LTC were hardly important or even particularly relevant a year or two ago, and now they're giants (compared to where they were- all cryptos are obviously still dwarfed by BTC). I believe that if you'd have put equal amounts of money into BTC and ETH at the beginning of this year, you'd have made more from ETH, but now the tables are turning back towards BTC.

Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that investing into crypto as a whole is a great long-term endeavor. Putting it all into one (or two, three, any amount really) and *leaving it there* isn't necessarily the best idea. At the very least, come back every now and then and make sure the coins you're in are still doing well, and still seem like they will be by the time you check again next month (or whenever).

Hope that helps!

P.S. - As for currencies to suggest, I'd throw out EOS, XLM, NEO, and more controversially maybe LSK, GNT, and ADX. I'm a bit too tired to explain why for any of them right now, though.

They also handle GAS for NEO if you are holding it.

They are also on boarding new coins very often and when they bring on new coins most of the times they have no fees or lower fees for trading it. They have a voting system so the community can vote on which coin they want to come to the exchange next.

5745,"Just to add one that hasn't been shilled yet (and of course which I myself hodl), Enjin coin is looking very promising heading into 2018. Still got a low low marketcap, but caught some attention yesterday as just about the only alt to moon while BTC was rising. It's had a healthy correction today since more than doubling in value yesterday, but the good news is that A) we seem to have a support level around 50% higher than a few days ago now, and B) it's back below ICO prices, so you can't feel ripped off buying in now ;)

Why did ENJ explode in value yesterday? Various factors, but Cryptokitties could be a big contributor: one of the main usecases for ENJ is bringing gaming to the blockchain with plugins and open-source developer SDKs, so that gamers can properly own the items they buy (created on the blockchain, not held on the game's server). Cryptokitties has acted a proof-of-concept for how well blockchain aligns with the virtual goods market, whilst also proving how Enjin Coin provides a better solution to this demand via their monolithic smart contract idea that allows transactions on greater scale with lower gas costs. 

Upcoming roadmap milestones are a simple secure mobile wallet towards the end of this year (helping to bridge the gap between gamers and the crypto world), and a Minecraft plugin and Unity SDK early next year, along with GoDot engine recently partnering with them. Apart from their (free, ad-less) wallet, all their SDKs are going to be open-source to help spur integration and adoption. One the cool things about ENJ is that the company behind it has been operating for 9 years already managing gaming communities, and has around 19m users on 250k communities, so they've got big potential network effects in place for when they launch.

5827,"Rule #1 Don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose. 

Rule #2 Hodl - this means through the good *and the bad.* It also means holding for **literal years** (like the next 5-10 if you want to really see profits). Bitcoin is due for a massive correction. It’s going to be scary but do not freak out. No matter how long it takes, bitcoin’s price has always recovered. Don’t believe people when they shout “bitcoin is dead”. It is nonsense FUD. 

Rule #3 buy the dips. 

If I were you, and if you have the money to spare and the nerves to handle it, I think putting a little more in right now isn’t the worst idea in the world. 

However, there’s also a very good chance that it doesn’t go up anymore. I’m just a stranger on the internet. Do not let strangers on the internet heavily influence your specific buys and sells. 

That said, 

I would also recommend having an exit strategy. Maybe not for your entire bitcoin portfolio, but for a substantial part of it. We are in a bubble and now is the time to take profits when these rare opportunities present themselves. Depending on how much money you put in, there’s a chance you could recoup your initial investment while still having some BTC to spare. Then buy in again once the bubble has popped (at much, much cheaper prices). 

If it helps, I’ve been around since the last bubble so I’ve been doing this for a while. Investing in bitcoin means emotionally preparing yourself for very intense rises and drops in price. Don’t let fear talk you into making bad decisions! When in doubt hodl for dear life.

Bitcoin isn't a currency anymore, it's something people are buying and just holding onto because it's way to expensive to send transactions and even if you do send that transaction it's gonna take a long ass time to send. Sure it is a store of value I guess, but when you can't end up moving that value somewhere else, how valuable is it really?

Just one dude on the internet's opinion though, but I'm out of BTC for now. I might come to regret it but ever since I started in crypto I was never into BTC anyways, the most I've owned at a time was $500.

Saying that, bitcoin just hit 20k here in Canada, and that's a little scary. I don't have enough knowledge to give you good advice on that one. Coin base is simple, secure and expensive.

Current levels are high compared to where we've been, but you won't care if you bought in at 13k or 16k when the price hits 40k by the end of the year. Ease your way in with a series of small buys and keep some money on the side to take advantage if there is a dip or correction. Learn about dollar-cost averaging and how it can help. Coin Mastery TV (Carter Thomas) has a great guide to that. Some of his recent videos deal with this exact situation. 

Alt coins are found on various crypto-to-crypto exchanges, so you purchase one of the big 3 on Coinbase (LTC or ETH for faster transfer times and low fees), then transfer to the exchange that has the coin you want. They all have XMR. IOTA is on Binance. If you come across a coin and want to find out what exchanges it's on, go to coinmarketcap.com, search for the coin, and hit the ""markets"" tab.

However, I've seen other posts saying that when bitcoin undergoes its major correction soon, alts should fall further as well. My question is, do y'all think today's discounts are an ideal time to invest further, or should I wait for bitcoin's imminent correction to hopefully get even deeper discounts?

No one has an answer to that. As you said, it's all speculation. I know it's unhelpful but it's the only truthful answer. BTC could crash hard and violently, and alts would likely crash with it. Or, BTC could slowly leak off and spread the satoshi's all around so alts will rise too. It's really hard to say which will happen, given that futures from Wall Street are rolling in Monday and the rate of people buying in as at an ATH. 

Personally, I'd buy right now though, if I were in your shoes. I'd be more comfortable with the regret of a correction hurting my portfolio (since it will eventually go back up, sooner or later -- if it's not a shitcoin PnD) than I would watching an alt I had my eye explode in value, knowing I missed it.

Which means from a technical standpoint (which is all that truly matters in the world of crypto) you don’t own your own investments as long as the exchange has a hold of the private keys. 

You will only truly own those coins once you also have a hold of the private keys that come with them.

6666,"Neo & Walton.

Neo will be decentralising its nodes starting late December or early January. The temporary centralisation of the project has been putting many investors off, but that's about to change.

They have a whole load of upcoming ICO's launching on their platform too, as well as NEX. NEX is an exciting decentralised exchange service that once set up will surely replace the centralised exchanges we know today that get overloaded / congested / hacked and fail to support extreme trading volumes (Binance yesterday is an excellent example of this, as well as Coinbase, well, pretty much all the time).

Waltoncain will be launching its very own brand spanking new blockchain in January/February, and will therefore switch from ERC20 to WTC. No more lagging due to digital feline overloads. They also offer a physical product already (a tag that connects an item, such as a shirt, to the IoT, readable and trackable with a hand-held reader) that will revolutionise the supply-chain industry.

There is a lot of exciting developments on the horizon for both, but I think the most promising thing about these projects is their association with Asian consumers; both are extremely well positioned for mainstream adoption. China seems to be rapidly piecing together a revolutionary ecosystem (check out Ontology, Onchain, THEKEY - specifically their ties with huge corporations like Fosun Group and Microsoft, and even the Chinese government) that could secure their nation as the global leader in blockchain technology",0.9883,daily_general_discussion_december_6_2017,0.051,0.771,0.177

6675,"Not a shill, I hold maybe $50 in ARK right now, but I really like the idea behind it, especially in context of fucking Cryptokitties. If one app (*a fucking Neopets clone*) on the blockchain can slow Ethereum down this much.. it's shaken my faith in Ethereum as a long-term investment, because the demands on the network are only going to increase from here, and if this keeps up, Ethereum's actual utility will be fairly limited compared to some of the newer offerings, and that can severely limit it's growth moving forward.

As I understand it (and feel free to correct me here), ARK was designed to have a sort of central blockchain for the currency itself, so that way transactions can carry on unimpeded, while smart contracts are executed on side chains that branch off from it, all while still being able to draw on the core blockchain's resources somehow... it kind of loses me here. But the upshot of this is that the core blockchain retains its primary utility while still finding a productive use for the excess processing power it has at its disposal.

What I'm getting at here is that the current crop of dominant cryptos do not appear to be designed with future growth in mind, and the only way to modify them in response to growth is by forking, which, as we have seen with Bitcoin, is a pretty damn contentious issue, and creates a lot of confusion and uncertainty as to which blockchain is the most ideal to use (Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash?), or which is the real successor (Ether or Ether Classic?). I think that while Bitcoin definitely sets the standard for what a cryptocurrency should look like, it definitely isn't the best implementation of blockchain technology, and as a first-generation tool, that is entirely acceptable. I suspect that Bitcoin will stick around for a long time. But with a second-generation crypto like Ethereum, I'm less convinced, and I'm increasingly of the opinion that ARK or another third-generation crypto like it will eventually overtake Ethereum for purely technological reasons.

There are other cryptos I'm interested in, such as Cardano, which seems to have a very solid academic foundation and an unusual dedication to detail for a new cryptocurrency (again, correct me if I'm wrong here). That, plus Cardano has the explicit goal of developing their currency to suit regulatory regimes in an entirely *optional* capacity, such as by encrypting indentifying information within the transaction itself, something that would be very attractive to large financial institutions as a replacement for outdated ACH systems. And it's doing all of this with an eye to implementing smart contracts within its wallet in the near future, basically rolling the functions of several existing coins into one.  *And* it's also designing its wallet to be user friendly, something that remains a major barrier to mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by the general public. ***And*** that wallet application can be optionally set to contribute to the block generation process, and actually earn currency for the holder- literally building a miner into the wallet, effectively guaranteeing a large base of processing power it can draw from and incentivizing ADA holders to contribute. The more I read about ADA, the better I feel about sitting on it for a long time, because it feels very underappreciated.

First of all you need to create an account where you can exchange FIAT(usd/eur) to BTC/ETH. Most popular choice is Coinbase but I would suggest you bitstamp.net since they have lower fees (0.1% compared to Coinbase's 1.5%).
If you want to invest in something other than BTC/ETH/LTC then you need to register to one of the exchanges that deal with alt-coins (Bitfinex,Bitrex,Binance) I prefer binance. They have lower fees and interesting coins. The interface is quite cool also. Check out advanced mode.

6935," Neo & Walton.
 
 Neo will be decentralising its nodes starting late December or early January. The temporary centralisation of the project has been putting many investors off, but that's about to change.

They have a whole load of upcoming ICO's launching on their platform too, as well as NEX. NEX is an exciting decentralised exchange service that once set up will surely replace the centralised exchanges we know today that get overloaded / congested / hacked and fail to support extreme trading volumes (Binance yesterday is an excellent example of this, as well as Coinbase, well, pretty much all the time).

Waltoncain will be launching its very own brand spanking new blockchain in January/February, and will therefore switch from ERC20 to WTC. No more lagging due to digital feline overloads. They also offer a physical product already (a tag that connects an item, such as a shirt, to the IoT, readable and trackable with a hand-held reader) that will revolutionise the supply-chain industry.

There is a lot of exciting developments on the horizon for both, but I think the most promising thing about these projects is their association with Asian consumers; both are extremely well positioned for mainstream adoption. China seems to be rapidly piecing together a revolutionary ecosystem (check out Ontology, Onchain, THEKEY - specifically their ties with huge corporations like Fosun Group and Microsoft, and even the Chinese government) that could secure their nation as the global leader in blockchain technology

Meaning you may make 3x as much with the 1080ti but it will be 3x or over as expensive as the rx 580. I would recommend thinking in terms of mining. You by no means need an i7 although the newest ones are actually capable of CPU mining pretty decently for the wattage (this is highly relative to your power cost) but ive seen some able to make roughly $20 a month on nicehash which is astounding. You don't need even close to that amount of ram 4-8 gb will do. What you are building here is a highly capable gaming pc that also mines. I would recommend 3 or 4 580s 4 or 8gb model for the price of that one 1080ti or a little more. And two smaller power supplies, a gaming motherboard, an I3 or I5 try getting cheap Haswell era intel setup. and somewhere where you don't mind heat or noise. The only thing is that 1080ti will hold its value better over time, but 580s are nothing to sneeze at anyway so you should have a good market when you decide to sell

Tether claims they have the reserves to back up the value of their crypto dollar per dollar, but that's plainly impossible, or incredibly deceptive at best. This brings the stability of Tether into serious doubt, and there is a nonzero chance that any money you put into Tether would be totally wiped out if news breaks that they're a sham. You cannot predict that. That's why it makes people nervous, myself included, and I would avoid Tether at all costs.

If another fiat-backed solution comes forward, I would be more than happy to support it if it was legitimate.

So, forget the USD value you Wall street guys.  It doesn't translate here.  BTC may crash down to 5k tomorrow.  Your NEO at 360k would be worth less than half its current USD value then.  You need to focus on its Sat value instead.

Keep in mind that their fees are generally higher than average, and don't keep your coins on the exchange.

So, XRP is at 2118 sats.  The current exchange rate puts that at $0.25 USD.  If the XRP market magically froze at its current rate, and the price of BTC goes up, then the value of those 2118 sats increases.  The all time high for XRP in USD was something like $0.27.  As the value of BTC increases, wall street types who only look at the USD value will sell their XRP and cash out.  So, this drives the BTC value of the coin down so it equals the new USD value of its BTC conversion rate.

IOTA is probably not going to drop significantly any time soon, and probably not ever back to anything below $2.40. It was already undervalued, and the partnerships it's been announcing have made it a pretty solid bet. It's clearly worth more than what it's being traded for right now. Hence why over the last day, we've been getting sudden jumps and long, stable periods like right now, while volume has steadily increased the entire time. We're just not seeing massive sell-offs that would drive a dip, and right now, it looks like the bulk of IOTA holders, myself included, are in this for the long haul. I'm inclined to think this is genuine, permanent growth that will not reverse unless something truly catastrophic happens, like a massive hack or theft of IOTA.

Basically, *buy in now if you want to jump aboard the IOTA train*. Even if it drops 30 cents tonight, IOTA is still undervalued at $3 and is still going to pass it pretty soon. You're not going to care much about saving 30 cents per coin in two months when it's grown 300% or more.",0.9766,daily_general_discussion_december_4_2017,0.027,0.801,0.172

I bought a little during the ICO and hope the project works out, but it will drop hard once people have access to their wallets.

None of the ICO buyers have been able to access their coins yet, so the only coins being traded right now are the ones being mined. So while it's nice that my coins are 7x right now, once people are able to sell the price will plummet. There are many people who have lost trust in the team due to their handling of the rollout and will want to bail as soon as possible. And those don't want to bail completely (like me) will be happy to sell a portion of their coins for a quick profit. My plan is to sell about a 3rd of my coins if I can get 3-5x.

I think it sounds like what people think Ripple is but on a smaller scale and big banks wanting to join will have to use the tokens you can currently buy (whereas it sounds like on Ripple big banks will have their own, independent network)

My reservations with Request is that it sounds like the Request token is only used to pay the fees for the request & payment and once they're used the tokens are burnt. My thought on that:
- it drives a very long term but slow price rise, which is nice
- but if the token costs too much the fee will be seen as too high and the number of users will drop, lowering the price, which could become a circle or just lose customers to other solutions
- having to purchase an ERC20 token to request or make a payment is a high barrier to entry so their fiat gateways are going to have to simplify that.
- A big player starting to use Request will buy up a lot of cheap tokens, making it harder for other players to join in the future (great for a short term price rise but maybe not long term).",0.8934,daily_general_discussion_december_2_2017,0.051,0.845,0.104

Other cryptos use proof of stake to ensure that new blocks are correctly added to the chain. Instead of solving cryptographic puzzles the nodes bet their crypto holdings. If one node tries to add an incorrect block to the chain, they will be found out, on account of all the other nodes adding another version of the block to the chain.

And if you took a random poll around your town I bet less than 1% of people actually hold crypto. More and more people are hearing the name and learning about it, but there's still a ways to go for widespread adoption. And with more institutional money coming into crypto with futures, ETF's, ect I personally believe there is still a lot of room for growth. 

In a trading arena with a constant marketcap its a 0-sum game, where to win someone else has to lose. But if the marketcap is constantly growing, there's more room for all early adopters/investors to make money on the way up.

Ark- Best crypto-wallet I've used, great voting/staking, use case seems amazing to bridge all the coins together, especially with how many coins are hitting the market in this ICO/fork era. Interesting writeup here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7glvo2/ark_is_the_next_big_thing_and_i_can_proof_it/

ETH- Processes an unreal amount of transactions at very reasonable fees and quickly, smartcontracts, ICO's, ETH does everything. Almost bulletproof investment in my opinion. Should continue to increase.

IOTA- I don't pretend to understand the tangle, but it seems like the go-to coin for enterprise free transaction. They've announced a lot of great partnerships recently and had a great bull run. That said, their wallet is pure trash, hoping for a better version soon. I guess they're more focused on their enterprise connections and product over making a better wallet, which is fair.

MOD- Mod is a coin I am incredibly excited for. I think supply chain management blockchains have SOOOOO far to grow, and I'm insanely hyped about a lot of coins in the field (WTC, MOD, VEN, WABI). Plus MOD has a team with a lot of connections in the field, and pharmaceuticals are an ever growing field. Absolutely love this coin. 

Overall I like them all (Pending research on REQ).   I am very confident holding ARK and ETH for very long term with little to no management, while for IOTA and MOD I'll keep a closer eye to see how the next 6 months go just to stay safe.

From there, you can get a taste of trading (BTC, ETH, LTC) through GDAX which is their trading platform.

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. That's probably the best piece of advice I can give you. You really do have to be totally willing to LOSE all of the money you've put in. Going with this strategy also makes you ""unattached"" to your money. 

Aside from that, just start by buying some BTC and ETH on Coinbase (I'd say use GDAX though because the fees are lower). If you look at the smartest people/investors in crypto, pretty much all of them hold these two coins (as well as most average Joes in crypto). They're both safe bets, with BTC being the safest as it is the most legitimate of all the cryptos and the ""foundation"" of all cryptos. 

I advise dollar cost averaging. Buy a set dollar amount every week. 

Aside from that, if you want to expand into slightly riskier cryptos, I (and most on here) would say that Monero is a great investment. There will ALWAYS be a demand for total financial privacy- for a variety of different reasons.

8349,"I've read a little bit about this (disclaimer: I am not a tax expert).

My impression is that cryptos are a form of investment no matter what, rather than a currency, and even though they can be used as currency, the net gain you make through those trades is what's taxed. So if you hold 4 BTC, you don't pay tax on those until you pull them out. That applies to paying someone too. If you pay someone 1BTC, that person can chose to pull it out or leave it to grow. If they pull it out, that is considered income, and so they will need to pay an income tax on it. If they chose to leave it, the initial value of the BTC will be treated as income, and any gains are taxed as capital gains.

The sticky part is trying to figure out if you owe a tax on the gains you made by holding the Bitcoin to paid to the other person. I would assume you do, and err on the side of caution by setting money aside to pay that tax.

I'm actually wrestling with this exact tax issue now- I was paid in cryptos this year and this is my current plan for how to treat it at tax time. It seems reasonable, but consider actually scheduling an appointment with the IRS and figuring out what your tax burden actually should be. They really do want to help you figure this out, because it's much more painful and expensive to audit you than if you're forthcoming about your investments and do it honestly.

As a sidenote, taxes are not fundamentally a bad thing, and I do not mind paying a significant tax on my earnings from cryptos, because that's just the responsible thing to do. If you want to be pissy about ""tax injustice"", please grow up, because the only reason you are able to live in a first-world country is because your tax dollars make it possible. If no one paid taxes, no one would have roads, education, public services, the military, FEMA, etc. If you want to live somewhere with no taxes, tough luck. Taxes are literally the only way stable governments can exist, and if you want to live in a stable society, right now, that means you have to pay taxes in order to keep it that way. That's been true since Ur in Mesopotamia 5000 years ago, and that's just as true now. Maybe in the future this will no longer be true, and governments won't need to tax anyone in some sort of libertarian utopia, but right now that is not what's happening, so pay your taxes like everyone else and be mindful of the massive, indirect benefits you derive from it.",0.9889,daily_general_discussion_november_30_2017,0.053,0.802,0.145

Really though, it has to do with your risk tolerance, time frame, and belief in the technology. Bitcoin is a bit of a conundrum. On the one hand, it's considered a safe bet, because it has name recognition, widespread support, and is the oldest crypto. On the other hand, it is very very bubbly, for exactly that reason. Many people buy bitcoin without having a single clue what they are buying, which sets up the market for a potentially horrifying crash. 

Generally, diversifying is good. Splitting up your investment reduces your risk. If you do that though, remember that the whole crypto market sometimes moves together, so even buying 10 different coins, you could get screwed if there is a downturn in the market.

Ok, I would probably get rid of ENJ, LTC, LINK and maybe NEO.
I hold LINK and LTC myself and LINK is great because of it potential merits.. decentralized oracles are the shit, but its probably too early to gain from that. Haven't looked at binance, maybe its also manipulated. Anyway.. LTC is great and all but it just has only minor benefits over BTC, even though LTC is is def superior, that doesn't mean that it will be a huge gainer.

I'd go in XMR. First of all, its the only REAL anon cryptocurrency. Second, fees are much lower than btc. So if I were to buy some drugs, I'd prefer XMR over btc because of both and over dash or eth because of the first reason.
The dev team is also pretty dope and looks competent.

Dont know much about REQ. Guys here hype it up and maybe they are right, dont want to judge something I haven't looked into tbh. VTC is for me similiar to LTC. Its been here for a long time and it gets a little hype but is it really going to be the next big thing? I dont think so. 

Almost forgot.. maybe go for some WTC or MOD. Both look pretty good, I def prefer WTC right now gainwise and productwise. Gainwise because it got masternodes and I remember Dash going crazy after they announced masternodes. Its a little gimmick for coins to boost the price and encourage hodling. Is it necessary for the blockchain? Not really but its good for the gains.

Ethereum (and bitcoin) both use inflation as a way to pay miners. Both will become less and less inflationary over time. Bitcoin will become net deflationary (as people lose private keys).

There's a slight chance people abandon ship from Bitcoin into things like Ethereum or Bitcon forks, however there's another aspect to think about. Most people who own Ethereum or the various Bitcoin forks are those who are more aware of the market. Once Bitcoin starts to bottom out, those people will sell their Ethereum/forked coins in order to get as much money as they can into Bitcoin before it starts rising again. Then once Bitcoin starts rising, even more people will get fomo and those who hodled during the crash will sell ETH/forks to ride the upswing of Bitcoin. This will definitely lead eth/forks crashing. 

tl;dr: Alts will crash because Bitcoin is the only currency you can use to buy many of them. ETH/Bitcoin forks might rise slightly until Bitcoin bottoms out. Once it bottoms and starts its climb back up, ETH/forks will crash as people fomo back into Bitcoin.

9306,"You need to read what comes next in that FAQ. The system has defenses to the 34% attack.

First:

""There are two lines of defense. First, because Ethereum is Turing-complete it is naturally somewhat resistant to censorship as censoring transactions that have a certain effect is in some ways similar to solving the halting problem. Because there is a gas limit, it is not literally impossible, though the ""easy"" ways to do it do open up denial-of-service attack vulnerabilities.""


And then the conclusion:

""Attacks against Casper are extremely expensive; as we will see below, attacks against Casper cost as much, if not more, than the cost of buying enough mining power in a proof of work chain to permanently 51% attack it over and over again to the point of uselessness. Hence, the recovery techniques described above will only be used in very extreme circumstances; in fact, advocates of proof of work also generally express willingness to use social coordination in similar circumstances by, for example, changing the proof of work algorithm.

Don't risk more than you are willing to lose. Bitcoin might be a good investment or it might crash in a week. Asking here, you'll get people who think crypto is the future. I agree. But the fact is none of us really knows. Build your strategy based on your risk tolerance. If you are more risk averse, spread your money among crypto, stocks, and savings. 

Second piece of advice. Try investing with a small amount first, or even with imaginary money. New investors and traders make a lot of the same mistakes, usually because they trade with too much emotion. You'll get better over time, and while you might get lucky, you should prepare to get burned a couple times.

Second of all, I believe that the market is very aware that corrections and crashes could happen at any time in the crypto space. Just look at what has happened with all China FUD and recent forks.

9524,"They're legitimate in that they exist and are [at the very least as traded tokens] used, but as for their legitimacy in the sense of being practical, possibly successful tokens that won't just die out over time... Well, that's a bit contentious. Many BTC and non-BTC Alt traders seem to think that Bitcoin Cash/Gold/Etc. are nonsense, or scams, or doomed, or any combination of the three. A handful of investors think they're good investments that will either take over Bitcoin or at least establish themselves independently (and therefor successfully) apart from Bitcoin, but that seems to be a vocal minority so far as I can tell.

That said, a decent amount of traders have gone a riskier route and traded the BTC-forks against BTC even without thinking the forks will be successful, just to take advantage of the 'wars' between them. Generally, the forks have been losing those wars, but occasionally a bit of news or hype will drive the fork up (see: Bitcoin Cash) and there's some real opportunity to profit from that, and hop back into Bitcoin before the fork pulls back.

In general, I'd avoid investing into BTC forks. At the most, you might be able to trade them with some success, but even that's getting riskier and riskier as BTC's price is pumping (though if it pulls back the forks may rise, but they might also fall alongside very other Alt if BTC pulls the market down with it).

If you end up having quite a lot of crypto, then you should probably look into getting a hardware wallet for it.

By the way, I'm saying you should use GDAX because it has less fees for buying.

No sure wins in a volatile space like crypto. You're considering investing a substantial amount in two high-risk options. You could be looking at heavy profits in a year, you could also easily lose it all.

If you've done thorough research and believe in those investments, go ahead, but I would consider adding Eth, Bitcoin, or Litecoin to hedge my bets. 

Having said that, I am invested heavily in both OMG and Vertcoin. I have more faith in OMG than I do in Vertcoin as a long-term hold. 

This is not investment advice, just my two cents. I have at least 50% of my portfolio in more established ""safer"" investments at all times and I won't touch these for years. Then I choose two or three medium-risk/high-risk options to hold (OMG, VTC, ANT) and I don't touch these for months.

Central companies oftentimes accompanied by private blockchains  OFTEN have an easier time doing this than a public blockchain DApps. A good real world example is Wells Fargo making hundreds of thousands of fake accounts and charges because their databases are private and they can ""get away with it"".

LTC is also a good bet, I think. It's poised to push past its ATH and probably break 100 soon, which should raise it even higher if it finally busts past that limit. It's becoming more and more adopted each day and has a pretty solid support in the 80's right now, I honestly think its price is just being held down by the mania that is going on with BTC right now. Many people have jumped ship from alts to get into BTC while it's on this major pump.

Also, I happen to like VTC too lol, just not as much as LTC and I don't think it's quite as promising as NEO (At least, again, in the short-mid term).

Tho im ready to take the risk, i have a stable job with good income so i would be able to just go on in life incase i lost it all, but if it would turn out the other way....

9898,"I'd like to preface by saying I'm financially conservative. 

I'm in a similar position to you. Very early in my career and I'm lucky enough to have some positive net worth to invest. Sure, if you had thrown caution to the wind and went all in on BTC/ETH, you'd be looking great right now. But anything that can see a 10x rise in such a short time can also see a 10x drop. You've got to be honest when you evaluate risk/reward. An annual 5-7% growth with relatively low risk is a great asset to be holding over the course of 20 years. If you threw $5500 in a reasonable ETF and forgot about it for 20 years, it will 99% sure be worth $15k-25k.

In 20 years there is as real a chance that BTC is a joke as there is for it to be at $50k+/BTC. In spite of what the crypto community thinks, crypto is HIGH RISK. And so, you need to put thought into how much risk you want to expose yourself to and honestly evaluate risk/reward on your investments.

My strategy begins with maxing employer matched 401k contributions. That is the best investment you can make imo. Very low risk, and you automatically 2x your investment. Next, I do a full 5500 contribution to a roth IRA. Stable returns, and between a 401k and an IRA you should be in a good position for a comfortable retirement. After those are taken care of, I feel more comfortable taking on a higher level of risk such as cryptocurrency. Best of luck. 

Edit: just wanted to mention ""diversifying"" by grabbing a variety of cryptocurrencies doesn't do a lot to reduce your risk from an outsider's perspective. There is merit to it, but a diversified crypto portfolio is STILL HIGH RISK.

 I would day trade eth and hold bitcoin. As the 24hour highs and lows settle into a 20-30 dollar or so range for example 450-470 per eth it becomes 1. more likely to have another breakout because it has consolidated at a level that has been validated by its relative stability, and 2. easier to set buy and sell limits and make some small gains per day. 

For example I tend to make $5-15 a day per eth day trading. The idea is to set your buy at $5-10 over the 24 hour low (ie 450 low I set a buy order anywhere from 450 to 460) and if the top was 470 I would sell from 460-470. Its that $10 buck or so predictable swing per day that you can take conservative advantage of and use to build up your working capital. The skill is knowing when to convert to USD to maintain earnings in market downturn. This is doable with bitcoin but harder to predict the highs and lows per day.

It's  effectively impossible to deduce the private key that corresponds to a public key.

A crypto address is a public key. Whenever you send a transaction often all you're doing is publishing a valid unspent output that has the following condition: anybody that can provide a particular message signed with the private key that corresponds to this address can access these funds.

So there's absolutely no danger in publishing addresses, they're designed for that. You only have to concern yourself with safekeeping its corresponding private key.",-0.2812,daily_general_discussion_november_25_2017,0.042,0.924,0.034

Right now this is the wild west. The ICOs that create true utility and become widely used are the ones that truly hold value other than a quick pump and dump market manipulation (ex. Tether). Think about Ethereum and its ICO in 2014 which is the basis and the operational blockchain for 90%+ of all ICOs today. The value of ethereum is Utility. 

So the speculation market will eventually become SOLEY based on utility, due to regulation. The market is already turning towards this. The community as a whole has FAR less tolerance for Shills, scams, and money grab ICOs than it did in years past, and there are a lot more eyes on reckless ICOs, fake teams and bullshit (ex.

It will lose out to solutions which implement transaction scalability, on-ledger governance and achieve true geopolitical decentralization.

Great post joskye, thanks...one question, reading this part I quoted, I can't stop but thinking ""so why BTC is still going up?
I know it goes up because more people get in it, but if BTC won't be able to be what is meant to be (a currency and not an asset) because of scaling problems, the day that this knowledge will be widely accepted will come and the interest in it will be lost...

I don't know which is the best, but RDN has a lot more value left in store for it. Trading barely a month ago, value has gone from a low of $1.30-$1.60 to about $3 now. The increase is slow and stable, major fluctuations seldom happen imo. 

The only major exchange holding it is Binance. So theres vast potential for new market cap when it eventually reaches places like Bittrex or Poloniex and becomes more talked about.

It provides a much wanted solution to ETH's scalability concerns. The tokens are used to speed up your transactions. MicroRaiden releasing end of November will further inflate the value. 

There is controversy surrounding RDN because of the ICO fundraising, but the increasing price clearly shows that no one really cares.

I agree with BTC, ETH, and XMR as good long-term holds, but I don't see why you would want to put the same amount of money in XRP and POWR.  Maybe if you went lower like 5% each XRP and POWR and 30% each the other 3 coins, I would agree more with that.

XRP - Investing in Ripple, the company, would be a great idea, but not so sure about the token.

POWR - Interesting idea, but still unsure about its practicality.  To me, it just sounds like an attempt to apply blockchain to a field that doesn't necessarily need it.

for example, even if the trezor or ledger supported every single coin, transferring them back and forth between exchange and wallet all of the time would just be really time consuming and could end up costing a lot, especially with BTC which is going to be your main trading pair. 

so yeah, basically i keep ~10-35% of my coins on exchanges at any given time just out of necessity.

In my early days, I went ""all in"" on a couple alts  thinking I picked a winner and could 4x my money. There were ups and downs, but also a few drastic downs. At that point I was ""bag holding"", or stuck holding a coin bc I'd bought in at a higher price and didn't want to sell at a loss. I eventually did eat the losses, called it a lesson learned, and reinvested into BTC/ETH. Those investments have made healthy gains. Turns out, if I had held BTC the entire time - I would have 4X my original investment anyway.

On average I'm up but I think that's as much to do with luck as anything else.

If you're looking for long term gains then slowly buying and holding BTC is the way to go, then if we're lucky you can pay back some college debts with it.

I think following these trends is going to be the best strategy.

11090,"so, here's the thing. one of the most important things i've learned this year is that almost everything always corrects, and if you're patient enough, you will always end up getting the price you wanted. but, that doesn't seem to apply to BTC, at least so far.

given the institutional money that has begun to roll in, it doesn't seem like BTC will correct _truly_ any time soon. now that will depend a lot on how the CME futures trading pans out, but it's really hard to say. 

on the other hand, ETH is on a nice little run, and it's been consolidating in a giant pennant for literally months. it's less than $10 away from breaking out of that pennant, and with the right volume and momentum, which seems to be building, ETH should break out _hard_, and will most likely smash its previous ATH. given this is the case, we could easily see $500-600 ETH by the end of the year. 

given the current trend line, if it doesn't break downward in the next day to two, which seems unlikely as of right now, you won't get another chance to buy under $350 for perhaps a very long time. so my advice for ETH would be to buy now, and set some reasonable stops. if it doesn't break, you can get out below $350 without any kind of serious loss. but if it's break up, you will be very glad you didn't wait. the risk reward is totally worth it right now, while with BTC it's a little harder to manage expectations. it's very possible we see 10k before the end of the year, but BTC is a unicorn, so trying to predict its corrections or runs is multitudes harder. 

my advice, but as much ETH as you can, set a stop just below $350, perhaps around $347.75, and ride the wave. (of course you should always be holding BTC, but i think that's a given). ",0.9299,daily_general_discussion_november_20_2017,0.047,0.875,0.078

If you want to sell your erc20 tokens for something else, then yes, you have to send those back to an exchange like binance and sell them there. But sending from MEW to binance is much cheaper than sending from Coinbase, as they have a huge fee. If you send from MEW (which is really just sending from the ethereum blockchain, as your coins aren't actually stored *on* MEW, because MEW just provides you with keys to access the coins on the blockchain) there is no fee other than the gas that is required to send eth or its tokens, which usually amount to pennies.",0.8885,daily_general_discussion_november_20_2017,0.027,0.862,0.111
11106,"i'm sorry that you've been down voted while just asking for help. ill try and help you out here. 

so, keeping coins on an exchange vs a wallet really depends on how often you think you're going to trade. if you want to just buy and hold, then yes, sending it to a wallet is your best option, as it's safer, and in addition stops you from emotionally trading since it's not as readily available. on the other hand, if you're going to be trading a lot, you should keep some on the exchange (probably some BTC as it has the most pairs on every exchange). 

to answer your question, if you want to sell your alt, yes, you will have to send it back and pay another fee. i'm not super familiar with the fees on binance, but since the most recent ETH fork, transaction fees are pretty cheap and super fast; so i probably wouldn't worry too much about fees unless you're trading _a lot_. and if you are trading that much, then you should probably just keep a decent amount on the exchange.

LTC is the cheapest fee right now at .001 LTC per withdrawal (with LTC at ~$72 right now, that's about $.007, a modest fee).

About Bittrex:

* It's the diversity of coins available for trading — **lots of them**
* It's if it is regulated — **they were one of the first companies to apply for the stringent New York's Bitlicense**
* It's if it is easy to take out your money/coins — **very easy to obtain the enhanced status that allows you to withdraw up to BTC 100**
* It's the easiness of performing your trades — **very simple**
* It's its security (have they been hacked?) — **nothing heard about that**
* It's its customer support when you have problems — **I don't know**
* It's the speed to process your orders. — **I can't tell if it is rate-limited but usually if you are selling and choose the buyer that covers your quantity of coins being sold, it goes smoothly; same for the opposite case**

11296,"BCH is here to stay and has many good selling points. Technically, they raise various legitimate concerns, regardless of whether you agree with them or not:

* The fear of block size increases is probably not rational. It's true that it may not be a long term solution, but it should alleviate pain in the short term. Best may be the enemy of better (see also: ""Why the Internet only just works"")
* Side-chain scaling in presumably mostly corporate hubs is a radical departure from the original Bitcoin, and the conflicts of interest between the Blockstream company on on-chain scaling are very real. It's possible that things will work out just fine, but there are many risks, including the Lightning roadmap that keeps being pushed further into the future
* SegWit appears to be a pretty complicated beast, and you have to use it carefully and consciously. There are many apparently thoughtful critiques on it such as this one; https://medium.com/the-publius-letters/segregated-witness-a-fork-too-far-87d6e57a4179. Someone in the know may debunk them, but as an outsider it's hard to tell who's right, and the lack of market adoption so far indicates that this thing is not being received well

BTC raises some good concerns in response as well. For one thing, BCH is primarily driven by miners, and it's not immediately obvious why you should trust them. The development team and governance structure is not clear to me and will have to prove itself. Some legitimacy could be gained by working with respected figures like Gavin (who endorses BCH already).

As someone else said, there may be another pump soon, and it appears that a majory of miners could support BCH. Other positive aspects include the Bitcoin branding and and the psychologically comparatively attractive price - would you rather get 1 or 5 Bitcoins for your money? The fact that BCH has adopted hard forking to improve the system - something that is a taboo in Core, but has been shown to work fairly well in platforms like Ethereum - means that they have a powerful tool at their disposal to improve their system (e.g. perhaps someone could come along, implement the Bitcoin NG protocol, and it turns out to work great), though there is of course some risk as well.

But make no mistake. BTC will survive - if necessary with a hard fork - and may retain the corporate backing it has, thereby giving it some edge. There is huge money involved, so these coins will continue to be traded and many will have a stake in preserving the value. However, if the scalability solutions keep being deferred into the future, it may be a problem for BTC valuations.",0.9941,daily_general_discussion_november_19_2017,0.096,0.72,0.184

*If any one of invested altcoin goes up by 15%, sell it and buy back on low price

i know this sub kind of hates on VTC because of all the shills, but i honestly think VTC is more technologically sound, and has a better community than LTC. that said, i can't see VTC taking over LTC's market cap anytime soon, if ever. 

LTC seems to have its own little niche market despite the fact that it has a lot of competition, and i think this just comes from its availability and name recognition, which if we extrapolate from BTC, we know that those two things are really important. if the general market continues with its bullish momentum now that the china and fork fud are over with, i can see LTC easily making a run back towards the $90-100, perhaps even breaking $100. 

in the long run, i don't see any great reason it should rise above its many other competitors given it's somewhat meh technology, but as we see with BTC, that doesn't always seem to matter. all things considered, i think it's a decent buy, and with it's general stability and somewhat predictable support/resistance points, it's actually quite easy to trade. 

anyway, i know that's kind of a lot of information and doesn't say anything super definitive, but that's my own general outlook. i hope you find it somewhat helpful.  ",0.9788,daily_general_discussion_november_19_2017,0.053,0.804,0.143

if you are not long term investing: buy the rumour sell the news buy the dump sell high.

and dont fall for the fud especially in strong coins. most newbies including myself have fallen in the fear trap

also use paper wallet or hardware wallet if long term. use always 2FA if using an exchange. if putting TOO much stake, ALWAYS operate your money from a linux live usb. dont trust windows

1. The 2x fork happens, people sell the BTC they have been holding, the price drops down to the 5k range, and all the alts go sky high back to pre-crash levels.

2. The fork doesn't happen, people get sick of all the BTC crap, sell the BTC they have been holding, ditto as #1.

3. BCC, or BCH (whatever these tards call it) pump starts again, and people sell BTC to get in on it.

4. No one cares about the fork either way, and BTC continues a bull run to 10k by end of Dec.

With all of those possibilities, and really, an unknown probability on each one, I would suggest any of the following.

1. Buy into BTC, and HOLD until Jan or 10k.
2. Buy into ETH, LTC, DASH and just ride the waves.
3. Buy into really cheap GOOD alts like NEO, LISK, FCT, ARK, VTC, QTUM, WAVES, etc...

11665,"Trading is not so difficult if the trader has access to the right information. There are laws governing any market and the cryptocurrency market is not an exception. The technology behind cryptocurrencies is based on the laws of mathematics. When a theory has been proved over and over again, it becomes a law. A very fundamental example is the law of demand and supply.

If we know that an increased demand in a product means higher prices, then we can correctly predict that the price of the commodity will go up because of the increase in demand. If we know that the supply of a commodity is much higher than the demand for it, then we can also accurately predict that its price will fall.

The reduction of trading to the level of mathematics has made it possible for us to be able to trade with mathematical certainty that we will always make profit when we follow the rules of trading. The challenge now is gaining access to the market parameters that help us reach our conclusions whether to buy or sell a coin.

In trading, having access to information is key. The more you know about the currency you are about to trade in, the better your ability to make the right decision. If for instance, a trader is able to know that the demand of a particular currency is increasing, then he can be able position himself before the demand begins to affect the price. So how can a trader get this much needed profit, the XchangeRate robot is a trading tool that automatically extracts the much needed data from the cryptocurrency markets. It keeps track of important data like the demand and supply levels, the market capitalization, the liquidity index and the Suitability Index in real time.

I don't think we'll see a rise in manipulation, as the people (whales) capable of it will already have their ways and places of/for doing it. Not to mention Coinbase is known for playing ball with the Government, so anyone attempting manipulation probably won't be interested in attempting any funny business on an account they have to tie to a real (or illegal false) identity to.

As for growth, I think we'd definitely see some growth in whichever coins get added but not necessarily as an entire market. For a lot of newcomers or crypto noobs that just wanted some BTC/ETH/LTC to hold, the coins offered by Coinbase have a sense of validity and security too them. I imagine a lot of people that aren't addicted to crypto like us and just wanted to make a good investment have just bought some BTC and *maybe* some ETH and/or LTC and just leave it in Coinbase. So, now we have a that new market of users that could see whatever alt coins that may get added and they'll throw some money at it hoping for some O.G. BTC level gains madness. This will then probably have a small, but hopefully noticeable, ripple affect across the rest of the coins with new money being added. But I wouldn't imagine it would make a giant difference.

In difference to Monero or ZCash the focus in development was on hiding your IP address. I really like the built-in TOR/I2P with the Verge client. As far as I know only Spectrecoin (XSPEC) has the same feature. Using these networks makes it harder to find out your IP. The main XVG developer believes that this is most important.
Monero instead has been focusing on obfuscating the transactions on the blockchain via ring signatures, ring confidential transactions (RingCT) and stealth addresses. This makes it harder to find out anything about your wealth or transactions using blockchain analysis. Monero developers believe this is the most important aspect of privacy.
Both projects agree that the security mechanisms of the ""other"" project is important and are trying to implement it themselves (Monero working on Kovri Project, Verge working on Wraith). Monero proponents also argue, that if you wan't to hide your IP you can still use TOR with Monero manually and they have tutorials on their site explaining how to do that. Many people on this reddit believe that XVG is a shitcoin, especially Monero fans. I am not sure if that is purely based on technical analysis or just FUD.  
  
Problems/Weakness of XVG:  
- Only one core developer (Sunerok) the project heavily relies on. He seems like a smart guy with a political agenda which I personally like. I suggest to watch 1 or 2 interviews with him which should be available on YT to form your own opinion about him.  
- Bad communication within the team (Setting up a website with a countdown for Wraith, even though Wraith was not done - it still isn't) Seems somewhat unprofessional.

Used to own XVG (bought between .0045 to .006) and sold it after Wraith wasn't released on time (~.0085). I still haven't lost faith in the project and follow it closely even though not involved in it atm. Hope this helps!",0.9871,daily_general_discussion_november_15_2017,0.06,0.788,0.152

12015,"It's not a damn bubble. That's just naysayers mad that they don't understand it. 

The thing about bitcoin, well crypto in general, is that even if it started as a scam, or ponzi, or whatever, **we believe in it now**. 

That's all that matters. There are millions of people that believe in it, and we will continue to believe in it whether it rises or falls. Because of this, it will continue to go up. It will ""pop"", drastically fall 40%, then rise to new highs. Over, and Over, and Over. 

The other thing is that people compare it to their native currency, because that's what they understand. What they don't understand is that regardless of whether governments accept it, it doesn't matter. 

Bitcoin/crypto is not equivalent to any single fiat. You can't compare it to the US$, or the Euro or anything, because it's not tied to a border. It's moreso equivalent to a comparison of every type of currency currently available on the planet. Take all of them. Make them accepted everywhere, and you have what bitcoin/crypto will be equal to someday. Until then, it'll just keep rising. Regardless of which crypto is the current king, regardless of the use types. It will keep rising, until massive adoption occurs, and paper money is no longer relevant anywhere. 

And to top that off, at the same time, it's not really a currency at all is it. There are so many different alts and techs being developed that aren't based on providing a monetary response, but instead creating a technology around an idea. Around end to end encryption. Around secure communication. Around privacy, freedoms, and transferance. That you can't really call a lot of them crypto currencies. It's really all a misnomer.

What is the true utility and therefore the true value of each cryptocurrency? Their utility probably isn't generating moon lambos, so when the moon lambo people leave it is hard to gauge what cryptos will remain and at what value.

Best bet would be to do some research, pick maybe 5 good solid coins. You can ask around the boards, but it's tougher to get non-biased views from anons who are looking for their own gains. But there are plenty of youtube channels and other resources that can break down what to look for with the different coins/tokens without making outright suggestions. Once you've picked your few coins start looking at some charts, and wait a bit until one of the pairings becomes more attractive to make your switches. There's still enough volatility in the markets that you can wait for a bump in BTC while another main coin takes a 5-10% dip. That's when you want to make your moves.

There have been a few cases like this with varying results, sometimes all the money is lost, sometimes people get it back, sometimes there's a lengthly lawsuit.

Things are perhaps a bit safer these days, and exchanges are perhaps backed by more legit companies, and more regulation these days that perhaps means you're more likely to get your money back. But there's always a chance that they could go bankrupt or just run off with your money.

I think the new alt startup model will be to get VC funding to get to a prototype (i.e. functional codebase) where an ICO is possible, compared to ICOs we saw happen this year with little or no codebase.  
  
New alts will have access to a large amount of open source code to pull from or build off of, so that needs to be taken into account, and there will be alot less technical uncertainty -- but in general, I see the current alts having a huge leg up in terms of early funding and of course timing, and so I will probably avoid new ICOs unless I see a very good value somewhere, and will probably wait 6-8 months before investing.

Generally It's recommended, regardless of whether you can stake the coin or not, you keep your coins in any wallet other than the exchange. This goes back to the Mt Gox fiasco, which'll be worth reading about. Exchanges hold all user funds in a single big wallet, and only when you move the coins off the exchange do they get put into your individual wallet.
If you anticipate that you'll be trading or selling the coins with any degree of regularity, you may want to just keep them on the exchange for convenience, but if you're holding onto them for a while, get a wallet set up.
It doesn't have to be the official wallet of each individual coin. There are some wallets which can hold many coins or tokens, such as Exodus wallet, or MyEtherWallet. There isn't anything wrong with using one of these in preference to holding your coins in the official wallet.  

If you're a newb, I'd recommend setting up a single wallet for one of your coins, leave the rest on the exchange for now, and work through your security precautions, and moving small amounts of money back and forth to make sure you get the hang of it.

12352,"Depends. Are you here JUST for trading? If yes, I guess volatile currencies are the currencies you should go for. If you want long term trading, find currencies with potential that you consider cheap.

If you want to just find currencies to invest in and support, there are hundreds on CoinMarketCap. Go look through them, make sure you read their Announcement threads (click their name and on the left side of the page you'll see a link ""Announcement"" or ""Message Board"" if you want to go to their forums) and always read a lot about the currency before even investing a cent in it. Some of them are scams, but don't always listen to strangers calling them like that... just keep reading about them and you'll most likely find a few coins to invest in, in just a few days. 

My ""pro tip"" is never let the emotions control you. So don't sell or buy in panic. This could go wrong for you.

And never buy coins just because you see ""+200%"" change. I'd personally rather buy coins that are DOWN than buying those that have doubled/tripled/etc in the last few days.

If you will be trading and you read news about currencies often, you may find opportunities. Read an important announcement fast enough and you might be able to take a choice before everyone else.. The best sources are Reddit, and obviously Google. Announcements are a great influence for the price.

That said, if I were you I'd go ahead and buy ETH anywhere in the 300-305 range.  I'd sit tight on BTC for the next week while we wait for this BTC/BCH situation to resolve itself, and in the meantime you can use that week to research alts and make a decision on where you want to hitch your wagon.  I like your alt selection and have shares of everything except DASH/LTC.  IOTA is probably my favorite long-term, followed closely by XMR & NEO.  LISK is worth owning given it's upside, I like the project and team, but it's definitely riskier than others so I wouldn't invest 20%, probably 10% at most.

Think deeply about what she wants here.  She wants an extremely expensive bag.  Why?  Is it really well made?  Is it going to last a long time?  What is the function the bag serves to her?

While many are dismissing the request and moving on to other thoughts, take a minute and really try and understand it.

It’s likely that she wants the bag because it’s a luxury item, and possessing it will make her feel a certain way.  Maybe it will make her feel good about herself.  Maybe it will make her feel special, powerful, rich, or unique.

Now we’ve all done stuff because it makes us fee a certain way, the thing about it is that feelings are feeling, your economic resources are finite.

I own a ""core"" portfolio that I hold no matter what...then I own some more speculative ones...or will buy excess of the core ones to do speculation with...I then can skim off some profits on ones that make a big move while still holding my core...

FCT has a simple model and a good business case. Great idea. However, it's very simple - too simple. Essentially it consists (gross oversimplification here) of recording a hash of your critical documents to a blockchain to prove provenance. However, my concern is that in three years time recording data to a blockchain will be routine and part of the standard set of tools, and there will be no need for a dedicated FCT chain. It's equivalent to buying licenses for Trumpet WinSock back in 1993.

PAY is linked to a single credit card, on the basis that people will pay a surcharge to transact directly in crypto rather than converting it yourself. There's multiple concerns with this idea, but one of the main ones is that this surcharge is only good as long as all of the banks stay out of crypto and no one charges a fee lower than 1.5%. As soon as major banks move in, they'll offer zero fee crypto cards to gain market share and TenX's current implementation will be dead in the water.

Another core assumption they've made is that people with crypto (hence with money) will pay a premium to pay with crypto, rather than paying on interest free credit and then selling crypto at the end of the month to reconcile their bills.

TLDR: BTC is centralized and filled with misinformation/censorships and controlled by a single entity. However, their propaganda has worked wonders and made many people think the opposite. The fact is, Bitcoin Cash is magnitudes more decentralized in terms of miners, multiple independent development/research teams, etc. There are 3 things that cannot be hidden for long; the sun, the moon, and the truth. Educate yourself and spread the truth. This is the only way to make a stand against misinformation and censorship.

People should get the full story of r/bitcoin because it is probably one of the strangest of all reddit subs.

r/bitcoin, the main sub for the bitcoin community is held and run by a person who goes by the pseudonym u/theymos . Theymos not only controls r/bitcoin, but also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com. These are top three communication channels for the bitcoin community, all controlled by just one person.

For most of bitcoin's history this did not create a problem (at least not an obvious one anyway) until around mid 2015. This happened to be around the time a new player appeared on the scene, a for-profit company called Blockstream. Blockstream was made up of/hired many (but not all) of the main bitcoin developers. (To be clear, Blockstream was founded before mid 2015 but did not become publicly active until then). A lot of people, including myself, tried to point out there we're some very serious potential conflicts of interest that could arise when one single company controls most of the main developers for the biggest decentralised and distributed cryptocurrency. There were a lot of unknowns but people seemed to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were apparently about to release some new software called ""sidechains"" that could offer some benefits to the network.

Not long after Blockstream came on the scene the issue of bitcoin's scalability once again came to forefront of the community. This issue came within the community a number of times since bitcoins inception. Bitcoin, as dictated in the code, cannot handle any more than around 3 transactions per second at the moment. To put that in perspective Paypal handles around 15 transactions per second on average and VISA handles something like 2000 transactions per second. The discussion in the community has been around how best to allow bitcoin to scale to allow a higher number of transactions in a given amount of time. I suggest that if anyone is interested in learning more about this problem from a technical angle, they go to r/btc and do a search. It's a complex issue but for many who have followed bitcoin for many years, the possible solutions seem relatively obvious. Essentially, currently the limit is put in place in just a few lines of code. This was not originally present when bitcoin was first released. It was in fact put in place afterwards as a measure to stop a bloating attack on the network. Because all bitcoin transactions have to be stored forever on the bitcoin network, someone could theoretically simply transmit a large number of transactions which would have to be stored by the entire network forever. When bitcoin was released, transactions were actually for free as the only people running the network were enthusiasts. In fact a single bitcoin did not even have any specific value so it would be impossible set a fee value. This meant that a malicious person could make the size of the bitcoin ledger grow very rapidly without much/any cost which would stop people from wanting to join the network due to the resource requirements needed to store it, which at the time would have been for very little gain.

Towards the end of the summer last year, this bitcoin scaling debate surfaced again as it was becoming clear that the transaction limit for bitcoin was semi regularly being reached and that it would not be long until it would be regularly hit and the network would become congested. This was a very serious issue for a currency. Bitcoin had made progress over the years to the point of retailers starting to offer it as a payment option. Bitcoin companies like, Microsoft, Paypal, Steam and many more had began to adopt it. If the transaction limit would be constantly maxed out, the network would become unreliable and slow for users. Users and businesses would not be able to make a reliable estimate when their transaction would be confirmed by the network. Users, developers and businesses (which at the time was pretty much the only real bitcoin subreddit) started to discuss how we should solve the problem r/bitcoin. There was significant support from the users and businesses behind a simple solution put forward by the developer Gavin Andreesen. Gavin was the lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto left bitcoin and he left it in his hands. Gavin initially proposed a very simple solution of increasing the limit which was to change the few lines of code to increase the maximum number of transactions that are allowed. For most of bitcoin's history the transaction limit had been set far far higher than the number of transactions that could potentially happen on the network. The concept of increasing the limit one time was based on the fact that history had proven that no issue had been cause by this in the past. A certain group of bitcoin developers decided that increasing the limit by this amount was too much and that it was dangerous. They said that the increased use of resources that the network would use would create centralisation pressures which could destroy the network. The theory was that a miner of the network with more resources could publish many more transactions than a competing small miner could handle and therefore the network would tend towards few large miners rather than many small miners. The group of developers who supported this theory were all developers who worked for the company Blockstream. The argument from people in support of increasing the transaction capacity by this amount was that there are always inherent centralisation pressure with bitcoin mining. For example miners who can access the cheapest electricity will tend to succeed and that bigger miners will be able to find this cheaper electricity easier. Miners who have access to the most efficient computer chips will tend to succeed and that larger miners are more likely to be able to afford the development of them. The argument from Gavin and other who supported increasing the transaction capacity by this method are essentially there are economies of scale in mining and that these economies have far bigger centralisation pressures than increased resource cost for a larger number of transactions (up to the new limit proposed). For example, at the time the total size of the blockchain was around 50GB. Even for the cost of a 500GB SSD is only $150 and would last a number of years. This is in-comparison to the $100,000's in revenue per day a miner would be making.

Various developers put forth various other proposals, including Gavin Andresen who put forth a more conservative increase that would then continue to increase over time inline with technological improvements. Some of the employees of blockstream also put forth some proposals, but all were so conservative, it would take bitcoin many decades before it could reach a scale of VISA. Even though there was significant support from the community behind Gavin's simple proposal of increasing the limit it was becoming clear certain members of the bitcoin community who were part of Blockstream were starting to become increasingly vitriolic and divisive. Gavin then teamed up with one of the other main bitcoin developers Mike Hearn and released a coded (i.e. working) version of the bitcoin software that would only activate if it was supported by a significant majority of the network. What happened next was where things really started to get weird. After this free and open source software was released, Theymos, the person who controls all the main communication channels for the bitcoin community implemented a new moderation policy that disallowed any discussion of this new software. Specifically, if people were to discuss this software, their comments would be deleted and ultimately they would be banned temporarily or permanently. This caused chaos within the community as there was very clear support for this software at the time and it seemed our best hope for finally solving the problem and moving on. Instead a censorship campaign was started. At first it 'all' they were doing was banning and removing discussions but after a while it turned into actively manipulating the discussion. For example, if a thread was created where there was positive sentiment for increasing the transaction capacity or being negative about the moderation policies or negative about the actions of certain bitcoin developers, the mods of r/bitcoin would selectively change the sorting order of threads to 'controversial' so that the most support opinions would be sorted to the bottom of the thread and the most vitriolic would be sorted to the top of the thread. ....contd https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/7c120p/btc_is_centralized_and_filled_with/",0.999,daily_general_discussion_november_10_2017,0.053,0.818,0.13

TLDR: BTC is centralized and filled with misinformation/censorships and controlled by a single entity. However, their propaganda has worked wonders and made many people think the opposite. The fact is, Bitcoin Cash is magnitudes more decentralized in terms of miners, multiple independent development/research teams, etc. There are 3 things that cannot be hidden for long; the sun, the moon, and the truth. Educate yourself and spread the truth. This is the only way to make a stand against misinformation and censorship.

People should get the full story of r/bitcoin because it is probably one of the strangest of all reddit subs.

r/bitcoin, the main sub for the bitcoin community is held and run by a person who goes by the pseudonym u/theymos . Theymos not only controls r/bitcoin, but also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com. These are top three communication channels for the bitcoin community, all controlled by just one person.

For most of bitcoin's history this did not create a problem (at least not an obvious one anyway) until around mid 2015. This happened to be around the time a new player appeared on the scene, a for-profit company called Blockstream. Blockstream was made up of/hired many (but not all) of the main bitcoin developers. (To be clear, Blockstream was founded before mid 2015 but did not become publicly active until then). A lot of people, including myself, tried to point out there we're some very serious potential conflicts of interest that could arise when one single company controls most of the main developers for the biggest decentralised and distributed cryptocurrency. There were a lot of unknowns but people seemed to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were apparently about to release some new software called ""sidechains"" that could offer some benefits to the network.

Not long after Blockstream came on the scene the issue of bitcoin's scalability once again came to forefront of the community. This issue came within the community a number of times since bitcoins inception. Bitcoin, as dictated in the code, cannot handle any more than around 3 transactions per second at the moment. To put that in perspective Paypal handles around 15 transactions per second on average and VISA handles something like 2000 transactions per second. The discussion in the community has been around how best to allow bitcoin to scale to allow a higher number of transactions in a given amount of time. I suggest that if anyone is interested in learning more about this problem from a technical angle, they go to r/btc and do a search. It's a complex issue but for many who have followed bitcoin for many years, the possible solutions seem relatively obvious. Essentially, currently the limit is put in place in just a few lines of code. This was not originally present when bitcoin was first released. It was in fact put in place afterwards as a measure to stop a bloating attack on the network. Because all bitcoin transactions have to be stored forever on the bitcoin network, someone could theoretically simply transmit a large number of transactions which would have to be stored by the entire network forever. When bitcoin was released, transactions were actually for free as the only people running the network were enthusiasts. In fact a single bitcoin did not even have any specific value so it would be impossible set a fee value. This meant that a malicious person could make the size of the bitcoin ledger grow very rapidly without much/any cost which would stop people from wanting to join the network due to the resource requirements needed to store it, which at the time would have been for very little gain.

Towards the end of the summer last year, this bitcoin scaling debate surfaced again as it was becoming clear that the transaction limit for bitcoin was semi regularly being reached and that it would not be long until it would be regularly hit and the network would become congested. This was a very serious issue for a currency. Bitcoin had made progress over the years to the point of retailers starting to offer it as a payment option. Bitcoin companies like, Microsoft, Paypal, Steam and many more had began to adopt it. If the transaction limit would be constantly maxed out, the network would become unreliable and slow for users. Users and businesses would not be able to make a reliable estimate when their transaction would be confirmed by the network. Users, developers and businesses (which at the time was pretty much the only real bitcoin subreddit) started to discuss how we should solve the problem r/bitcoin. There was significant support from the users and businesses behind a simple solution put forward by the developer Gavin Andreesen. Gavin was the lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto left bitcoin and he left it in his hands. Gavin initially proposed a very simple solution of increasing the limit which was to change the few lines of code to increase the maximum number of transactions that are allowed. For most of bitcoin's history the transaction limit had been set far far higher than the number of transactions that could potentially happen on the network. The concept of increasing the limit one time was based on the fact that history had proven that no issue had been cause by this in the past. A certain group of bitcoin developers decided that increasing the limit by this amount was too much and that it was dangerous. They said that the increased use of resources that the network would use would create centralisation pressures which could destroy the network. The theory was that a miner of the network with more resources could publish many more transactions than a competing small miner could handle and therefore the network would tend towards few large miners rather than many small miners. The group of developers who supported this theory were all developers who worked for the company Blockstream. The argument from people in support of increasing the transaction capacity by this amount was that there are always inherent centralisation pressure with bitcoin mining. For example miners who can access the cheapest electricity will tend to succeed and that bigger miners will be able to find this cheaper electricity easier. Miners who have access to the most efficient computer chips will tend to succeed and that larger miners are more likely to be able to afford the development of them. The argument from Gavin and other who supported increasing the transaction capacity by this method are essentially there are economies of scale in mining and that these economies have far bigger centralisation pressures than increased resource cost for a larger number of transactions (up to the new limit proposed).

12889,"Remember that the NYA hard fork was controversial since the beginning and not only because it lacked consensus.

* A 51% attack is a potential attack on the bitcoin network whereby an organization is somehow able to control the majority of the network mining power (hashrate). 
* AntPool (China) controls 17.8 % of the total, DiscusFisf/P2Pool (China) controls 16.5 %, BTC (China) controls 13.7 % and BW Pool (China) controls 7.7 %. You got 55 % of the total control in these 4 companies in China, a lot of centralization.
* So we have significantly centralized mining, located in an authoritarian state (China), and there is an open agreement for a majority of this centralized hashing power to shift to a new chain. This so-called New York Agreement(NYA) of May 2017 was meant to be the ultimate compromise.
* BCH (bitcoin Cash) would not have survived were it not for Chinese miners, associated with ViaBTC, owned partly by Bitmain and supported fully by Jihan Wu, founder of Bitmain. This represents a violation of the New York agreement to keep Bitcoin united. This essentially makes the New York Agreement null and void.
* Segwit2x clearly wants a hard-fork for a mere 1MB increase in blocksize limit. They want a new coin that would keep BTC´s name

It’s also controversial because of design choices made by the development team behind BTC1 (or B2X), the software client associated with the New York Agreement. Perhaps most importantly, this development team, led by Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik, has so far refused to implement replay protection, a measure that BCH did take.


But why won’t B2X implement replay protection?


The first reason is that replay protection would require simplified payment verification (SPV) wallets (those who don´t need to download the whole chain to make transactions) and some other thin clients (like Electrum) to upgrade in order to send and receive transactions on SegWit2X. Replay protection would, therefore, like BsX developer Garzik says, “break” SPV wallets; they wouldn’t be compatible with SegWit2X until upgraded.


What is he really saying? ‘cause if SegWit2X were to implement replay protection (and if SPV wallets don’t upgrade), these wallets could still send and receive transactions on BTC perfectly fine, AND, they wouldn’t accidentally spend B2X when they don’t mean to.


In the other hand, if the SegWit2X chain does not implement replay protection (and if SPV-wallets don’t upgrade), users may not be sure if their wallet is receiving or sending BTC transactions or B2X transactions or both. They also may not be sure if the balance in their wallet is a BTC balance or a B2X balance or both. And if hash power moves from one chain to another over time, these wallets could even change from displaying BTC balances to B2X balances or the other way around without users knowing. SO, not implementing replay protection on SegWit2X could arguably “break” SPV wallets in a much worse manner.


The only (plausible) scenario where implementing replay protection would perhaps not break SPV wallets much worse is if there is no BTC to speak of. Indeed, the New York Agreement very specifically intends to “upgrade” Bitcoin, rather than split off into a new coin as BCH did. And, based on miner signaling and statements of intent by several big Bitcoin companies, some NYA signatories claimed that BTC will not be able to survive at all.


Implementing replay protection is, therefore, sometimes considered an admission that B2X will split off from BTC into something new that will be THE BTC.


This is the reason why it has also been suggested that B2X is rejecting replay protection: for the precise motive of being as disruptive as possible so that if the BTC chain is effectively made unusable, B2X might stand the best chance of being recognized as “Bitcoin.”",0.9109,daily_general_discussion_november_8_2017,0.062,0.861,0.077

Massive amounts of daily research starting with the Bitcoin white paper and then all the forums, articles, blogs, tweets etc. that I can find. I did the basics right- I read the whitepaper first and understood what the crypto was, how it would be generated, etc.

I recommend the same for alts. While you can pick up some of the talked about alts at places like this, use them only to decide what alt to research. You may hear XYZ, ABC and DEF and feel those are three good opportunities. But they are only three different research projects you will have to undertake, starting with the whitepaper for each. I wouldn't invest in any crypto I don't really understand. And many forums are used for pump and dump runs.

For storage, I soon developed a crypto moto- if you don't have money to buy a hardware wallet, you don't have money to invest in crypto. You can store BTC, ETH and a lot more cryptos on hardware wallets, including ERC20 tokens.

1. I took part in their Pre-Sale the first day. In the first day they had this ETH address 0x0f5ee401De162Cd163b6Ff46318Eef2727dBb9fc and in second day they changed their ETH address to  0x9442384D4Ed3Dd45D468b7f09d29627EeD7C2B6D, Which you can see in their ICO page currently.
2. They never sent 10% bonus which they said in the ICO page.
3. There was a guy who mistakenly sent 15.4 ETH to the ICO, and he asked his ETH back, and they provided him his ETH just because the guy promised them to advertise their ICO in their icodaily website. And the fishy thing was that, They never asked for the MOI Tokens with that guy, neither he sent it.
4. It says in their page that they have 19 Team, but i checked into their linkedin profile, they say they have lots of experience but nobody has even over 100 Connections. When people have that much experience and reputation, most of the people have 500+ connections.
5. If this ICO was legit, we would see at least some of the Developers, or any team member in their Promotion Video. The promotional video is done by the paid artist. This is a Huge Red Flag.
6. The only moderator in the slack said, he would have a youtube interview with Boxmining(Crypto Youtuber) but never had, you know why? Cause they are scam.
7. Their ICO page says, they already raised over 1400 ETH but thats not right. Its a Blockchain, You can’t mutate or hide anything. They are lying about it so that people would jump in thinking they might miss the Pre-Sale. 
8. I tried searching the team members everywhere except, I couldn’t find any of them except in linkedin. So those are random images of people with random name.
9. Have you seen any group picture of the team or any member? Nope, i don’t think so. WHY? Because they have no team.
10. There are too many mistakes in the whitepaper, and they have plagiarized lots of it from the Gnosis whitepaper, Also in the promotional video of the ICO, the guy mentions moirai.com. In fact their website is ico.moirai.com You think a serious company would make that kind of mistake?
11. The ICO has only one moderator in telegram, and most of the time he is offline, Never answers any question from the People.

13234,"I can shed a little light on this. I worked in pharma cold storage law in the United States. I am also a health inspector. 

First of all, assuming a temperature is going to be the way it is not how we do business. Every temp restriction is monitored. Frozen, cold or ambient. You can't not monitor it because you don't want to or think it's fine. Corps always anticipate harsher laws. Cradle to grave monitoring is honestly the way to go with food, medical services, hazardous materials and a whole bunch of other products, and they know it. Governments will embrace it too because they can and they want to. Believe me, if we could track hazardous materials on the blockchain, we'd have a way safer and less cumbersome (paperwork) approach to tracking.

Environmental monitoring is expensive and clumsy. Usually you have multiple layers of defense. These include wired or wireless sensors for every storage area, and backups (battery powered collection devices). A couple problems arise from this though.

* Warehouses are frequently remodeled quickly, making tracking the sensors very difficult
* Sensors are often lost or destroyed
* Wireless signals can be difficult to receive and are inconsistent.
* Devices need to be calibrated regularly
* Goods jumping from one monitoring device to another (site to site) need compiled reports.
* Warehouses themselves cannot monitor. They have to use 3rd parties
* Backups require site visits (plane rides, labor)
* Data has to be compiled into reports with proprietary software
* Errors have to be explained and determined
* Real time downloading is difficult, especially for audits

Modum certainly is not re-inventing the wheel. But the blockchain gives this system distinct advantages:

* Everyone has access to the data at all times
* Packages can be tracked easily through the supply chain. Drugs that went from warehouse A to warehouse B, to transport, to delivery can be confirmed from beginning until end.
* Data can be validated on the block chain. It's difficult to change or tamper with.
* It's easier to have more sensors (less manpower) so sensors can track packages rather then sites
* Package centric sensors remove the error with remodels or lost sensors
* Packages are quicker to validate and send to their location of most need
* Auditors can audit without inspecting the facility. 
* 3rd party monitoring can compare their data easier with the blockchain

Think about it this way. If you are a restaurant owner, and someone offers to sell you chicken that you can validate has been at safe storage temperature it's entire existence, you'd probably buy that chicken over chicken without that validation. The health inspector that comes can see that too, and knows that you've not only handled it right, but the vendor has too. The blockchain is super useful is solving regulated supply chain issues like this. It really removes a lot of the friction in this industry. 

It's a lot about ""talking"" to one another. If I use hazardous materials and create waste (like waste oil). I have to call a special shipper to pick up a special drum with a special label. Then he has to give me a manifest (it also has to go to the state and feds), then then the process continues forever until tons of paper and stops and manifests pile up. Inspectors spend tons of their time simply sorting out this kind of stuff. Where did it go? Who took it? When? 

In any case, MODUM is most likely targeting a buy out from another monitoring company like SGS, ECHELON or other companies that specialize in sensors or monitoring equipment. Which is ingenious because they offered a token as their company value. Any buyout will most likely (that's the only risk here I think) result in a large payout to token holders. In a $15 billion dollar industry, that payout for innovative tech could be huge.

The fact that BTG's code was not made public until the day before the fork helps explain why the market's confidence in BTG was so low, hence its low valuation.

Stellar Lumens also has a partnership with IBM, they will start processing cross border payments among some currencies. 

I see growth but I don't know how much. I own minuscule amounts of goth(less than $10) and for the most part I haven't seen much XRP growth in half a year. Mostly stayed around $.18-$.32. Lumens gave me a decent return so far though.

2. ETN decided to go live anyways without letting any ICO investors obtain their tokens or wallets.

3. ETNs ""simulated"" mobile mining app, mining pools set up by the developers, and regular node mining were set to launch.  But the mobile mining app failed and it sounds like most pools failed.

4. So professional miners gobbled up all early blocks and then sold on cryptopia before any of the ICO investors were able to access wallets.

5. Apparently some ICO investors are now able to access their coins (when the website is up), BUT no official word because all the telegram admins have stopped responding to questions on the 25,000 member telegram channel.

I'm a big fan. IMO, it solves all of Bitcoin's problems through it's governance system. No need to argue for years on end over tiny changes when you can just vote. Stakeholders are in control rather than miners, and it is self-funding so need to rely on funding from outside interests whose interests may not align with those of stakeholders (e.g. Blockstream). Ultimately, it's governance system will enable it to easily grow and adapt in the future.

Other than that, there are a few great developments coming up: Lightning Network integration, enhanced privacy, Ledger support. The dev team is one of the best around, very innovative and meticulous in making sure things are done right.

ETH has slowed down during the second half of 2017 but is likely poised to grow as its first generations of distributed apps come online in mid 2018 to early 2019.

LTC has been pioneering atomic swaps and did its first test with VTC not too long ago.

VTC is older than most realize, and has demonstrated consistent results from its development team.  It’s community also seems to have a larger ratio of holders to investors than most other cheaper coins, which has helped it grow even during the most recent altcoin pullbacks and BTC bull-runs.

A privacy-focused messenger app that will run on the network is currently in development and it will be released at the end of the year.  Currently, you can stake with any number of ODN and receive 10% reward annually, although it might be reserved for masternodes (10k ODN stakers) in the future. 

Obsidian just went through a pump and dump recently and the price is stabilizing near the ICO price. The marketcap is around 7mil, which is tiny, and I think this is the best time to get in.

Some beginner tips:
Don't just hop in randomly to buy something with green figures. research before you trade a coin, what's the buzz, news, trade analysis and history.
Buy low (at a dip) and sell before the peak. Don't get greedy and wait to long, or the price will be dipping again.
Master your emotions, don't impulse buy (FOMO, fear of missing out) when you see a coin sky rocketing. By the time you have bought in it might dip and you'll be stranded with your overpriced coins. Also don't succumb to panic selling when your coin is suddenly dipping very fast, it will probably (not always...) go up again in some moments time.

I think it's going to pop somewhere in between the 7k-10k range, but it's impossible to tell. 

Sell all your btc somewhere in that range, hold your fiat, and then once the bubble pops start DCA buying back in on a monthly basis as we fall. You'll get a lot more BTC for you buck and the bear market won't feel as bad. 

It'll be hard to tell when the bubble pops, but it won't be that hard to tell for that long. It'll soon become obvious. That's when I would start buying

Shapeshift is an intermediary, it gives you an eth address that you send your ether to, once you do that, it sends the siacoin equivalent to the eth you sent, at your chosen address.

This should be your process

1. Buy eth from coinbase
2. Go to shapeshift and set sia address (your wallet) and eth refund address (your coinbase address)
3. Shapeshift will ask you to send eth to a specific address
4. Send a small amount of eth to that address as a test
5. Once it confirms you sent it eth, it will send you sia to the wallet you specified.
6. Sometimes it performs multiple deals, e.g. you shapeshift 3 eth, you could have 3 separate sellers selling 1 eth at that price so it executes that.

14117,"**Exchanges**

* 2FA is indeed must have
* Make sure your browser does not store your credentials
* Never store a lot of value on an exchange
* Keep only what is needed on exchanges: deposit when you want to trade, withdrawal immediately after
* Make sure you are verified on the exchanges you use: This makes it possible to quickly withdraw everything when needed, and I do believe they'll less quickly think your account is suspicious (AML)
* Keep an eye at your login history and once in a while double check the numbers of your assets and orders on the exchange
* When I generate a wallet address on an exchange, I put the address in a text file, then hard refresh the exchange website, (even log out and log in again), to see if it is still the same address
* Each time I deposit, I check the address again, even though I have it stored in a text file (also use Etherscan to verify that you've deposited to this one before, and it's indeed an address of the exchange)
* Only use the bigger / more known exchanges, and do your own research about them


**My wallets**

I have one hot wallet for assets I will trade in the short term. I have two cold wallets for hodling (harder to access).
*Edit: I setup a laptop for my cold wallets, but these days everyone suggests to use a hardware wallet, like Ledger. Therefore, I removed my way of working in this comment.*


**General**

* Avoid any suspicious links & downloads (I'd advice to download shady stuff (torrenting) on a different computer)
* Never type in an address, always copy paste!
* Double check the address for each transaction
* Never store a private key in its plain form, at least use the encrypted Keystore / JSON File with password protection
* Never send a private key via any online medium to anyone
* Try to understand how the blockchain works. So many people don't understand the basics, which leaves a lot of margin for error or manipulation. (F.e. Your cryptos are not *on* MEW)
* Do a lot of small transactions between your own wallets: it should feel as easy as riding a bike
* Never tell strangers on the internet you have cryptos, or how you securely store them (*hmmm*)
* Only invest what you are willing to risk / lose
* When using a hot wallet, always check the URL of the client you use (always use bookmarks or type URL manually)
* When participating an ICO, double check the ICO address with a friend or via chat
* Always use common sense and try to avoid transactions while intoxicated",-0.501,daily_general_discussion_october_29_2017,0.056,0.887,0.057

I doubt many will start with loopring or chainlink. Although, eventually, when you have some of the top 3 built up, I would look into Binance, great team, awesome interface (IMO) and worthy coins. Best wishes. Also keep in mind day trading is extremely addictive. Be careful about what coins you do chose, and take your time. For instance, if you see a coin just spiked upwards %50 to all time highs, it *will* come back down soon thereafter. Be patient, calculate at what satoshi level you would want to spend and just set the order and wait. It may not happen, may take a couple hours, although in the end, cooler heads prevail. Also, download software wallets and protect your private keys! Try not to leave more than %20 of your holdings on exchanges. I had a friend who lost a lot of money when MT Gox was hacked. Be very careful with opening emails from slack teams, and just be aware that all sorts of shady coins and people are constantly trying to rob you.
